Fewer termite species were found in cacao (19) than in forest (29). Species absent in cacao included specialist soil-feeders (Apilitermes, Crenetermes, Cubitermes) and specialist wood-feeders (Microcerotermes, Nasutitermes). Conversely, more generalist soil-wood-interface-feeders (Termes, Amalotermes) were more frequent in cacao. Mean earthworm densities were 80 m(-2) in the forest and 81 m(-2) in the unsprayed cacao, significantly higher than in either low or high sprayed cacao treatments (52 m(-2) and 57 m(-2) respectively). The dominant forest epigeic, Eminoscolex lamani was absent in cacao. Rosadrilus camerunensis, the sole anecic and dominant cast producer had reduced population in cacao and was absent in the high fungicide treatment. The role of this species in ecosystem functioning is highlighted and methods to maintain population, including improving litter quality and reducing soil contamination discussed."

L.; Duo, L.","Impacts of carbon nanomaterials on the diversity of microarthropods in turfgrass soil",2017,"Scientific Reports","10.1038/s41598-017-01920-z","Nanoscale materials have been produced with unprecedented speed due to their widespread use, and they may eventually be released into the environment. As effective adsorbents for heavy metals, carbon nanomaterials can be used to immobilize metals in contaminated soil, but little information is available regarding their effects on soil microarthropods. This study was designed to investigate the influence of three types of carbon nanomaterials, graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on soil microarthropod communities under turfgrass growth conditions. The application of carbon nanomaterials resulted in increased abundance of all soil microarthropods, especially in the GO and CNT treatments. GO also significantly increased the abundances of multiple trophic functional groups, including predators, detritivores, herbivores and fungivores. Further, the dominant genera varied among the treatments. Herbivorous microarthropods predominated in the control, whereas predatory species predominated in the carbon nanomaterial treatments. Carbon nanomaterials also increased the total taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity index, and dominance index of the microarthropod community, but they decreased the evenness index. Higher diversity of soil microarthropods indicates an environment suitable for soil mesofauna and for enhanced decomposition and nutrient cycling in the soil food web."

TMEs consisted of intact soil columns ( diameter 17.5 cm; length 40 cm) taken from a grassland or, in one case, from an arable site. The TMEs were taken from the same site where the respective field study was performed. The tests were performed in Amsterdam ( The Netherlands), Bangor ( Wales, England), Coimbra ( Portugal) and Florsheim ( Germany). Concerning the enchytraeid overall abundance and the number of species, differences between sampling points and differences between the TME tests and the respective field-validation studies were not found in the controls. Generally, a high variability of data which reduced the probability of determining statistically significant differences was determined. Effects of the model chemical carbendazim were determined for the overall abundance of enchytraeids and the number of enchytraeid species. The clearest dose - response relationship was found for the abundance of the genus Fridericia. The abundance of the genera Achaeta and Enchytraeus was not affected. Effects were most pronounced 8 and 16 weeks after application of the test chemical. The observed effects appeared not to differ between the TME tests and the respective field-validation studies. Due to the high variability of data NOEC-values could often not be determined. The EC50-values derived from the TME pre-test, TME ring-test and field-validation study indicate that the reproducibility (i.e. the variation between the partners) of the EC50-values was reasonable, although different soils were used at the different sites. The EC50- values for effects of carbendazim on enchytraeid abundance ranged between 0.5 and 28.4 kg a. i./ha (corresponding to 0.7 - 37.8 mg/kg), on the number of species between 7.2 and 87.4 kg a. i./ ha (9.5 - 116.2 mg/kg) and on the abundance of Fridericia between 0.7 and 18.6 kg a. i./ ha (0.9 - 24.7 mg/kg). Since one specific taxon has the potential to be more sensitive for a chemical stressor than other taxa, it is recommended to include investigations on the species level in the assessment of TME or field studies."

These communities can be perturbed by ionizing radiation from natural radiation sources or from radiation originating from nuclear accidents such as those at Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island. We used experimental manipulations of wood quality due to differences in exposure to ionizing radiation among tree trunks and ambient radiation levels of the soil to test the hypothesis that radioactively contaminated wood would result in a negative correlation between the abundance of soil invertebrates colonizing slices of wood and level of radioactive contamination. We extracted soil invertebrates underneath decomposing wood using mustard powder diluted in water. The abundance of soil invertebrates extracted was highly repeatable at study sites and decreased with increasing ambient radiation and total dose measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Four 10 cm thick slices of ca. 70-year old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) were deposited at 20 sites and the invertebrate taxa and their colonization and their abundance was assessed annually during 2014-2017. There were more soil invertebrates under uncontaminated than contaminated slices of wood. In addition, there were more soil invertebrates in areas with less ambient radioactivity, and there was an interaction effect between contamination of wood and ambient radiation implying that the role of contamination differed among slices. Finally, there was an increase in the abundance of soil invertebrates under wood slices during 2013-2017 implying that the abundance of soil invertebrates increased over time. These findings imply that the abundance of soil animals colonizing wood slices was dependent on background radiation, radioactive contamination of wood and the interaction between contamination of wood and ambient radiation.

As a result, our knowledge about anthropogenic-induced changes in biodiversity and associated soil functions is limited. We quantified an array of soil biological constituents (plants, earthworms, nematodes, bacteria, and fungi) to explore their interactions and to characterize their influence on various soil functions (habitat for soil organisms, air and water regulation, and recycling of nutrients and organic waste) along a legacy Cu pollution gradient. Increasing Cu concentrations had a detrimental impact on both plant growth and species richness. Belowground soil biota showed similar responses, with their sensitivity to elevated Cu concentrations decreasing in the order: earthworms > bacteria > nematodes > fungi. The observed loss of soil biota adversely affected natural soil bioturbation, aggregate formation and stabilization, and decomposition and mineralization processes and therefore resulted in compacted soil with narrow pore size distributions and overall smaller pores, restricted air and water storage and flow, and impeded C, N, and P cycling. The simultaneous evolution of soil biodiversity and functions along the Cu gradient emphasized the key role of soil life in controlling ecosystem services. Furthermore, results indicated that different soil biodiversity and functional indicators started to decline (10% loss) within a Cu concentration range of 110 to 800 mg total Cu kg(-1)."

C.","EFFECTS OF HEAVY METAL SOIL POLLUTION ON NEMATODE COMMUNITIES AFTER THE AZNALCOLLAR MINING SPILL",2010,"Nematropica","","In 1998, the rupture of a mining reservoir containing mineral residues polluted a large section of Guadiamar River Basin in southern Spain with heavy metals. To determine the effect of the spill on soil nematodes, soil samples were collected in 24 locations in a non-polluted area (48 samples) and in 57 locations (89 samples) in the polluted area. Soil content of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn) was analyzed. Maturity Indices (MI, MINO, PPI, Sigma MI) and Diversity Indices (Trophic Diversity (T), Shannon-Weaver (H'), Simpson (D), Margalef and Camargo) were calculated to assess the effects of soil pollution on nematode communities in the polluted area. Differences in heavy metal content were observed between the non-polluted and polluted sites. Forty-five nematode genera were identified, with decreasing numbers in the polluted area five months after the spill. Nematode taxa abundance and frequency, as well as diversity and maturity indices, were all negatively affected by the toxic sediments. Factorial Analysis of Correspondence, used to infer nematode sensitivity to metal soil pollution, showed six different associations of nematode genera associated to different metal content ranges. The effect of soil covering by the toxic mud on total number of nematodes was demonstrated experimentally. The diversity and maturity of the nematode community was significantly lower in the polluted than in the non-polluted area five months after the spillage. Ni and Cu seemed to be the metals most toxic to the nematode community."

Along this gradient, observed species richness of soil macro-organisms seemed to be more affected by the land-use type than by soil pollution - minimum in crops (21), maximum in woody Sites (126). IndVal index allowed isolation of 21 indicator species from the 339 morphospecies identified. Most of these indicator species were characteristic of the unpolluted sites: only two diplopods and one gastropod from polluted poplar plantations, and none from the most polluted site. Since soil invertebrates respond to different environmental factors, including direct effect of heavy metals we suggest there may be some confounding factors generating spurious relationships between the values of species as bioindicators and the pollution status they are supposed to indicate.

The aim of this study was to assess the response of earthworm communities to a gradient of metal pollution. In 11 sites located within 4 kilometers of the smelter, according to the dominant wind direction, characteristic soil parameters and total metal contents were determined and 9 earthworm species were collected. The Kmeans clustering method, applied to the first two axes extracted by Principle coordinate analysis on species abundances, allowed to separate the 11 sites into 6 groups depending on their pollution status and the type of vegetation cover (cultivated soils, grasslands, poplar plantations). Significant differences were found between the 6 groups for the total density of earthworms, which varied from 392 ind.m(-2) in unpolluted grassland to 2 ind.m(-2) in the metallophyte grassland, where soil pollution was higher than in the other sites. Intermediate densities were found in unpolluted poplar plantations with 271 ind.m(-2) (but only 57 ind.m(-2) in polluted stands), and 52 ind.m(-2) in unpolluted cultivated soils. Metal pollution also reduced species richness (from 6 to 1 species). Aporrectodea caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica appeared to be the most sensitive to heavy metals. A. caliginosa was dominant in unpolluted grassland (about 45 ind.m(-2)), absent in the most polluted site (35000, 8271 and 190 mg kg(-1) for Zn, Pb, and Cd, respectively), and present in polluted poplar plantation (1112, 616 and 12 mg kg(-1) for Zn, Pb, and Cd, respectively) although at a very low density (less than 1 ind.m(-2))."

In the north of France zinc smelter waste created a gradient of zinc concentration from 171 to 19 000 ppmin 35 m. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil pollution on the composition, density and diversity of macrofauna communities. The results showed that heavy metals reduce the overall density of earthworms and other macrofauna populations. The composition of the macrofauna community changed with the degree of pollution. There was no simple relationship between soil zinc content and species richness. In polluted areas, the number of species could be lower, equal or higher than in unpolluted zones. Increase of species richness in some polluted zones was due to the settlement of tolerant arthropod taxa. Coleoptera and some Arachnida were possibly favoured by the litter accumulation resulting from the reduced population densities of earthworms and other decomposers.

Effects of three to four different contamination levels (originally 10, 30, 90 and 270 mg kg(-1)) were studied. Nematode density was significantly reduced by 90 and 270 mg kg(-1) Se as well as by 270 mg g(-1) Cr, while 90 and 270 mg kg(-1) Se also reduced nematode generic richness. Maturity Index values (calculated for c-p 2-5 nematodes) consistently decreased with increasing Cr and Se concentration and to a lesser extent in Zn plots as well. Structure Index showed decreasing trends in increasing Cr, Se and (to a lesser extent) in Zn treatments, while in Cd it shows a moderate increase. Distribution of c-p groups was negatively affected by the increasing Cr and Se concentration, while in Zn plots, this decrease was not significant. Response of feeding groups to pollutions was similar to other parameters: Cr and Se caused significant changes toward the loss of variability. The proportion of the most sensitive omnivorous and predatory nematodes decreased clearly as a consequence of Cr and Se treatments. Zn pollution also resulted in a slight decrease in this group, while Cd caused an increase. Nematode diversity profiles showed a significant decrease in the plots of increased Cr and Se concentrations, while increased concentrations of Cu and Zn resulted in ambiguous effects. Besides providing evidence on the harmful effects of Cr and Se on a soil nematode assemblage, our results suggest that simultaneous analysis of Maturity Index, Structure Index and diversity profiles provide a promising tool in nemtological indication of soil pollution.

Nematode samples were taken in the framework of a complex food-chain experiment which is being carried out after artificially contaminating a part of an agrobiotope. The 13 heavy metals and microelements involved in the study are the following: Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, and Zn. Parallel plots receiving maximum concentrations equal to approx. 270 ppm were sampled twice during a complete vegetation period of winter wheat. Nematode abundance and richness as well as Maturity Index data revealed that Se and Cr had significantly negative effects on assemblages, while Zn appeared to have a generally positive influence on these parameters. Impacts by the other elements are less obvious or quite neutral (like that of Al). Favorable soil conditions and time elapsed (over 5 years) since the contamination, both resulting in a decrease of available element concentrations, may account for the not very pronounced effects."

A total of 89 species were recorded. In forests, the total number of species was high and the oribatid community was made up mainly of forest-specific species. Scheloribates laevigatus (Koch, 1835) predominated in dumps and reclaimed sites, whereas its abundance was lower in meadows and minor in forests. Tectocepheus velatus sarekensis Tragardh, 1910 and Scheloribates latipes (Koch, 1844) were numerous in dumps and meadows, but their abundance was low in forests. Punctoribates punctum (Koch, 1839), however, was found in high densities only at dump sites. Detrended correspondence analyses and hierarchical cluster analyses show that oribatid mites of dump habitats grouped together with those of reclaimed and meadow sites, indicating high faunal similarity and low richness, whereas the forest inhabiting oribatid community was much more diverse. The results of our studies indicate that colonization of dumps is mainly by species of wide ecological preferences."

In the first experiment, cropping systems with combinations of tillage (conventional or reduced), biocide application (conventional or reduced), and fertilization (chemical or cattle manure compost) were compared. In the second experiment, five treatments including four fallow Managements that received different levels of tillage, biocide, and organic matter input from vegetation were compared. The springtail (Collembola) population was higher with less tillage, less biocide application, and more organic matter input in both experiments, and these effects were additive; there was no specific combination of practices that has an interacting effect. The mite (Acari) population was also higher under most conservational treatments, and a significant interaction effect between tillage and organic matter application was found. A large increase in the Acari population under the combination of reduced tillage and higher organic matter input suggested that beneficial effects of these practices on the Acari community could be increased by integrating these practices. There was no significant correlation between the microarthropod populations and plant cover or soil chemical/physical properties measured. Slight changes in soil environments caused by agricultural practices may affect microarthropod communities substantially even before the changes in soil properties become detectable."

Ecological risk assessment of contaminated sites requires ecotoxicological studies with spiked soils as well as in-situ ecological observations. Here, we report laboratory and field assessment of copper toxicity for earthworms at a Danish site (Hygum) exclusively contaminated with an increasing gradient in copper from background to highly toxic levels ( > 1000 mg kg(-1) dry soil). More specifically, we report effects on field populations, body contents of copper, hatching of earthworm cocoons and reproduction of the common species Aporrectodea tuberculata. Abundance of earthworms and cocoons decreased significantly from about 400-150 m(-2) along the gradient as the soil copper concentration increased from ca. 50 to ca. 1000 mg kg(-1). At lower concentrations, the population was dominated by endogeic species, whereas at high concentrations the population was dominated by epigeic species. At high copper contents the internal concentration of copper was in the range 100-160 mg kg(-1) dry tissue. Despite the high internal copper contents, hatchability of field collected cocoons was not impaired in any species. The EC50 reproduction value of A. tuberculata was about 220 mg copper kg(-1) dry soil in the first two exposure periods, but nearly doubled in the third period suggesting that an acclimation response had occurred. Also in the laboratory reproduction test, cocoon hatchability was not reduced, but rather slightly stimulated by copper. Based on these results we discuss the possibility that acute exposure in laboratory experiments is more detrimental than exposure in a field situation, perhaps because increased tolerance may be acquired through natural selection and genetic adaptation through increased use of defense mechanisms such as metallothioneins. Further, we discuss that the rather high tissue copper level of earthworms from the Hygum site may have smaller effects in these free ranging worms than it would have in acute-exposure laboratory tests because the copper is more efficiently sequestered and detoxified in the field situation where populations have been exposed for many generations."

The effects of tillage, herbicide application, cover crop and mode of planting were evaluated in a 4 year-long replicated field experiment. Twenty-eight species of Oribatida and 35 species of Gamasida were represented in willow plantings. The predaceous Gamasida had more pronounced changes in abundance and diversity in response to the site preparation treatments than saprophagous and mycophagous Oribatida. Results indicated that (1) soil cultivation had negative effects on the abundance and diversity of soil mites during the first year of the experiment, later superceded by other factors; (2) the use or lack of tillage contributed to differences in mite community structure; and (3) following the initial disturbances, the abundance and diversity of soil mites increased in all treatments up to the end of the experiment. The success or failure of the willow crop and the changes in soil environments created by the different plant communities could explain the differences in soil mite populations among treatments best, especially 2 and 3 years after the beginning of the experiment.

The experimental control was hand-weeded (no herbicide). Two site preparation treatments were used: conventional (disked) and erosion controlled (no-till with cover crop of winter rye). The influence of herbicide application on non-target organisms (soil mites) cannot be generalized, with groups being differentially affected. Overall, Oribatida were most affected by herbicides. Among specific herbicides, azafenidin and oxyfluorfen had a negative effect on density and species richness of soil mites. The response of Oribatida and Gamasina to herbicides was species-specific. Two species of Oribatida (Sellnickochthonius immaculatus (Forsslund) and Liochthonius lapponicus (Tragardh)) declined significantly in all herbicide-treated plots. The cover crop residue had positive effect on both Oribatida and Gamasina; the negative effect of herbicides on Oribatida was greatly mitigated by cover crop. Herbicides appear to reduce mite diversity and alter community structure, but they do not always affect abundance. We speculate that the sensitivity of Oribatida to herbicides can reflect the indirect impacts of herbicides on soil microflora. ."

All treatments were tested at two irrigation schedules, with similar amount of water at a daily or weekly basis. In general, daily irrigation reduced first-quality fruit yield compared to weekly irrigation. Mulching with black polypropylene (MyPex (R)) and rape straw had a positive effect on first-quality yield and shoot growth, only black polypropylene, compared to herbicide treatment, whereas mulching with paper wool reduced first-quality fruit yield compared to herbicide treatment. Cover crop as tagetes and weed harrowing had similar yield as herbicide treatment, whereas cover crops as grass and hop medick and weed cutting reduced first-quality yield compared to herbicide treatment. Earthworms thrived under rape straw contrary to under black polypropylene and plots with weed harrowing. Treatments had significant effects on species numbers of plants both years, and total vegetation cover generally increased in the second year. Rape straw supported a high production of apples and a large stock of earthworms; however, its support of wild flora is poor, when it is taken into account that a large proportion of the flora in the rape straw was rape established from seeds left with the straw.

The copper fungicide (at 0.75 and 7.5 kg Cu ha(-1)) and the treatment with the pesticide mixture (Cuprafor Micro(A (R)) at 0.75 kg Cu ha(-1) and Swing Gold(A (R)) at the recommended dose) did not affect Oligochaeta communities compared with the control, except the Shannon index for earthworms in the mixture of both fungicides. Responses of the two annelid families to the tested pesticides were different with higher effects observed on the diversity and the community structure of earthworms compared with enchytraeids. This study allowed detecting early changes on oligochaete populations after pesticide application."

The pellets contained in spent ammunition are mainly composed of lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb). Total concentrations of these metals were measured in soils from seven sampling sites within a clay pigeon shooting range and compared with two controls to investigate the effects of their increased levels on the oribatid mites and Collembola community. We found that the spatial distribution of Pb and Sb contamination in the fall-out area is strongly related to the flight path of pellets. Oribatid and Collembola communities are able to survive at levels of heavy metals far higher than the lethal concentration for the most tolerant plants but oribatid mites seem to be affected by heavy metals more than springtails. Collembola and oribatid mites exhibit a wide range of responses to disturbance and many species are more strongly influenced by microhabitat characteristics than Levels of pollution. The effects of annual cultivations conducted in the shooting range and those of heavy metal pollution result in a simplification and homogeneity of community composition. Among arthropods, oribatid mites and springtails have a great potential as bioindicators of environmental conditions; the issue remains as to whether differences in population structure can be used to determine the type of disturbance.

According to German regulations, herbicides can be applied in mixtures with variable intensities. The ecological impact of the resulting strategies is still poorly understood. However, it was hypothesized that the influence of herbicide strategies on earthworm abundance. biomass, and diversity is minor compared to environment and tillage intensity in sugar beet. Therefore, additional specific factor variation seemed to be a prerequisite for getting valuable results. The herbicide strategies were applied in a ploughing system and a mulching system in 19 environments (site x year) in Germany in 2008 and 2009. Earthworm expulsions were carried out in spring and autumn with 2204 samples in total. The earthworm population was determined by environment and tillage system rather than by herbicide strategies. The environments displayed the largest variability in earthworm abundance, ranging from 12 to 195 individuals m(-2), and a considerable variation in the occurrence of earthworm species. In spring, the deleterious impact of ploughing, with 80% lower mean earthworm abundance compared to the mulching system, was observed across all environments. During vegetation, the stronger increase in earthworm population in the ploughing system did not compensate for the initial differences. Regardless of intensity, the herbicide strategies were not accompanied by corresponding detrimental effects on earthworms between each other. In conclusion, the earthworm population was subjected to a multiplicity of influencing factors and the results markedly demonstrated for the first time the negligible effect of herbicide application intensity in sugar beet.

Correct assessment of its impacts on soil ecosystems requires an understanding of the response of soil food webs. Nematodes, often the most abundant invertebrates in soils, occupy various positions in food webs, and their assemblages are commonly used to reflect soil health. In October 2014, we collected soil samples from five sites of a small-scale mining area in Sibutad, southern Philippines, to assess the influence of mining activities on nematode assemblages. Two sites were considered undisturbed as there were no visible signs of mining, while the other three sites were disturbed. Nematodes were extracted live and identified to genus level using morphology -based identification. We analysed genus composition, genus and trophic diversity, and the life-history based maturity index. We measured soil environmental variables (pH, organic matter, granulometry and several heavy metals), and correlated variation in nematode genus composition to variation in these environmental factors. Small-scale mining activities had variable but generally non-significant impacts on soil properties, altered vegetation and caused increases in concentrations of Hg and Pb, but not consistently so in all impacted sites. The high patchiness in vegetation and heavy metal content were reflected in a high within-site variability of nematode assemblages. Total nematode abundance was significantly lowest in the most physically disturbed site, but not so in the most metal-polluted one, suggesting that abundance is not a good indicator of pollution status. Nematode genus composition significantly differed between disturbed and undisturbed sites. By contrast, only few differences between sites were found for diversity or maturity indices, demonstrating that genus composition was a better indicator of mining-related effects than many common indicator indices and highlighting that detailed assemblage analysis is required for a correct interpretation of moderate pollution effects on soil nematodes. Measured environmental variables together explained 60% of the variation in nematode assemblages in the area; the three 'single best' explanatory variables were the concentrations of Pb, Hg and N, but none of these by itself explained more than 8% of the variation in nematode data, while their combination explained 24%. Some genera of predacious and omnivorous nematodes, which are generally expected to be sensitive to both chemical pollution and physical disturbance (e.g., Ironus and Eudorylaimus), were most abundant in sites with elevated heavy metal concentrations, which can have repercussions for the interpretation of nematode-based indices such as the MI."

In this work, trophic groups and metabolic footprints of soil nematodes were measured using 193 samples from the mining, natural and agricultural areas in this district. We explored the relationship between soil health and nematode communities. High lead concentrations were quantified: mean 8500 mg kg(-1) for total and 340 mg kg(-1) for DPTA in this mining area. Although nematode diversity was broad (81 taxa), their diversity, abundance and metabolic footprints significantly reduced in the mining area. Significant differences in the nematode community structure were observed, and the relative abundance of predators was sensitive to mine and agricultural activities, whilst omnivores reduced only in the agricultural area, and bacterial feeders exhibited a differential response to both anthropogenic disturbances.

Speciation of zinc in pore water was considered and CaCl(2)-exchangeable zinc concentrations were used as a measure of the bioavailable zinc fraction. After contamination, a reduction of total zinc and an increase of labile sorbed zinc over time occurred, concurrent with various changes in soil and biological characteristics. Data analyses on the nematode species revealed different sensitivity levels for several population and community endpoints to zinc exposure. Based on no observed effect concentration (NOEC) values, the most sensitive community-level response was obtained with principal response curve (PRC) analysis, which incorporates all density data in a single analysis. The PRC-based community NOECs were 56, 100, and 100 mg total Zn/kg dry soil after 3, 10, and 22 months of exposure, respectively. Based on 0.01 M CaCl(2)- exchangeable zinc, the community response appeared to increase, as NOECs were 4.9, 4.4, and 0.67 mg exchangeable Zn/kg dry weight. Total density was least sensitive, followed by diversity of taxa and the Shannon-Wiener index. NOECs for separate species covered a broad range from sensitive to tolerant species. This range of sensitivities was similar to the one found for other species groups tested in the field plot soil. A comparison was made between benchmark concentrations HC5 and HC50 derived from the general SSD of soil organisms for zinc and the nematode response data. These comparisons roughly confirm the predictions of the SSD model, that is, the community NOEC is in agreement with the benchmark that should protect the soil ecosystem's integrity, and large adverse effects were found at the benchmark derived for setting remediation urgency."

Species intolerant to drought are absent in grasslands, but present in old forest stands. Also the fraction of thelytokously reproducing microarthropods is higher in old forest stands compared with low-input grasslands. The main difference between low-input and high-input grasslands is found in the feeding guild structure of the community. Low-input grasslands are dominated by (herbo-) fungivorous grazers, whereas high-input grasslands are dominated by fungivorous browsers. Application of DDT in high-input grasslands shows a high density of microarthropods with a high fraction of thelytokous reproduction, associated with a decrease in genetic variation in a thelytokously reproducing species. Patterns in species losses, the species filters, are explained and discussed. It is shown that the decline of biodiversity is not a random loss of species but follows an identifiable pattern."

Exp. Appl. Acerol. 19: 000-000. The hypothesis that soil mites capable of digesting fungal cell-walls by chitinase activity in their guts are more exposed to heavy-metal pollution, for instance lead, than other fungivorous soil mites was tested. Heavy metals accumulated in fungi are located in particular in the cell wall. Mites piercing the fungi and digesting the contents will not raise their body burden of metals significantly. Mites ingesting fungal material but unable to digest fungal cell walls (fungivorous browsers), may have a somewhat higher exposure to heavy-metal pollution. However, mites ingesting fungal hyphae and digesting all the cell walls (fungivorous grazers) will encounter the most pronounced effects. A test of this hypothesis in an industrial site predominantly contaminated with lead showed an almost complete absence of the most vulnerable group: the fungivorous grazers. A second test in a clay pigeon shooting range showed an inverse relationship between the density of fungivorous grazers and the amount of lead in the soil. Fungivorous grazers at that site also appeared to have a much higher body burden of lead than other mites. Finally in laboratory experiments, it is shown that fungivorous grazers accumulate lead faster than fungivorous browsers."

Sampling was done monthly, from the period of early cultivation of the cotton until the crop was full grown. The scheme concerning the dominance classification was adopted. Aggregation of the dominant species was estimated in relation to insecticide effect. Rhysotritia ardua ardua appeared to be insecticide-loving species (insecticide-resistant species) and was not influenced either by the sort of insecticide or by its quantity. Multiple application of two insecticides has a significant negative effect on the abundance of Scheloribates laevigatus.

The changed vertical distribution of mites in the most polluted soil was also observed, due to accumulation of heavy metals in the Of/h horizon."

Despite the similar overall Pb pellet load at the shooting ranges, reaching up to 4 kg m(-2), Pb concentrations in the top soil of the abandoned range has decreased due to the accumulation of detritus on the soil surface. As a consequence, soil animal communities were shown to recover from Pb-related disturbances by utilizing the less contaminated soil layer. Microarthropods showed the clearest signs of recovery, their numbers and community composition being close to those detected at the control site. However, in the deepest organic soil layer, the negative effects of Pb were more pronounced at the abandoned than at the active shooting range, which was detected as altered microarthropod and nematode community structures, reduced abundances of several microarthropod taxa, and the total absence of enchytraeid worms. Thus, although the accumulation of fresh litter on soil surface can promote the recovery of decomposer communities in the top soil, the gradual release of Pb from corroding pellets may pose a long-lasting risk for decomposer taxa deeper in the soil."

We studied the relationship between microbial biomass and the abundance of microbivore and the role of grazing on nutrient turnover after annual addition of carbon (sucrose), fertilizer (NPK), fungicide (benomyl) and bactericides (streptomycin and penicillin) to two dwarf shrub communities, a low and a high altitude heath. After four years of repeated additions, we measured microbial biomass by fumigation-extraction and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio by PLFA analysis and estimated the numbers of protozoa and nematodes, assigned into feeding groups. The fungal to bacterial ratio of nematode feeding groups was around 0.2, indicating a bacterial-based food web in both communities. The size of the microbial biomass did not change after the additions, except when the amount of available carbon was increased (low altitude heath) or when addition of carbon was combined with fertilizer (high altitude heath). In contrast, fertilizer but not carbon increased the number of microbivores. This suggests that the amount of available carbon and not grazing pressure controls the size of the microbial biomass, Furthermore, it suggests that the food quality, e.g. nutrient content of the micro-organisms, had a larger effect on the microbivore than the size of the microbial biomass. The addition of bactericides and fungicide did not significantly change the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio of the micro-organisms. We could not detect any effects of the bactericides. In contrast, the fungicide strongly decreased nematode density, least in the fungal feeders, probably due to increased abundance of the insensitive Aphelenchoides ssp. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, soil contamination with heavy metals is a major concern for human health, food safety and soil food web health. In a previous study we reported on the human health risks of heavy metal contamination in soil in 43 vacant lots in two low-income neighborhoods, Hough and Weinland Park, located in two post-industrial cities, Cleveland and Columbus (Ohio, USA), respectively. In this study, we determined the relationship between heavy metal concentrations and the soil food web health using nematode community as a surrogate in the same lots. A general absence of higher trophic level omnivorous and predatory nematodes and an over-abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes indicated the disturbed nature of the urban soil food web. When compared to the USEPA's Ecological Soil Screening levels (Eco SSLs) only Zn was established as a metal of concern for soil invertebrates which was also negatively associated with nematode Channel index in the multiple regression analysis. A combination of As, Cd, Cr, soil texture and organic matter were significant factors associated with nematode abundance and community indices in the regression analysis. Bacteria and fungus feeding nematodes in the Hough neighborhood were negatively correlated with As and positively with Cd and Cr; whereas plant parasitic nematodes were positively correlated with Cr, % silt and active carbon content, perhaps due to the influence of these heavy metals on the nematode food sources. In Weinland Park, neighborhood, channel index was negatively correlated to Cd and Zn concentration. Soil Pb and Zn concentrations that were elevated in these vacant lots beyond natural background concentrations did not show any significant associations with the nematode community; whereas the metals present within background concentration, i.e., As, Cd and Cr were correlated with the opportunistic bacteria and fungus feeding nematodes. Principal component analysis revealed different clustering of heavy metals, soil properties and nematode parameters in the two cities, indicating unique associations. Results showed that soil Cd and Cr concentrations were positively associated with the abundance of lower trophic level nematodes in both neighborhoods. Additionally, strong correlations between As, Cd, Cr, organic matter and soil texture influenced the nematode population densities and should be further explored."

We investigated the relationship among soil microbial community composition, nematode community structure and soil aluminum (Al) content in different vegetated aluminum-rich ecosystems. Our results demonstrated that there were greater soil bacterial, fungal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass in Syzygium cumini plantation, greater abundance of soil nematodes in Acacia auriculiformis plantation, and greater abundance of soil predatory and herbivorous nematodes in Schima wallichii plantation. The concentration of water-soluble Al was normally greater in vegetated than nonvegetated soil. The residual Al and total Al concentrations showed a significant decrease after planting S. cumini plantation onto the shale dump. Acid extractable, reducible and oxidisable Al concentrations were greater in S. wallichii plantation. Stepwise linear regression analysis suggests the concentrations of water-soluble Al and total Al content explain the most variance associated with nematode assembly; whereas, the abundance of early-successional nematode taxa was explained mostly by soil moisture, soil organic C and total N rather than the concentrations of different forms of Al. In contrast, no significant main effects of either Al or soil physico-chemical characteristics on soil microbial biomass were observed. Our study suggests that vegetation was the primary driver on soil nematodes and microorganisms and it also could regulate the sensitivity of bio-indicator role mainly through the alteration of soil Al and physico-chemical characteristics, and S. cumini is effective for amending the Al contaminated soils."

Ivermectin concentrations in soil beneath dung pats ranged from 0.02mg/kg dry weight (3mo) to typically <0.006mg/kg dry weight (5-7mo). Earthworms were abundant and species-rich at the Swiss and Dutch sites, less common with fewer species at the French site, and essentially absent at the Canadian site. Diverse but highly variable communities of springtails were present at all sites. Overall, results showed little effect of residues on either earthworms or springtails.

The composition of the nematode community and diversity indices was strongly affected by heavy metal soil content (especially by Pb, Cu and Zn). Comparing polluted and non-polluted areas, taxonomic diversity was more different between areas than functional indices. While diversity indices were negatively correlated with metal soil pollution until the last sampling date, by the end of the survey (46 months after the pollution incident), as indicated by maturity and food web indices, the functional status of the soil community was nearly recovered.

The use of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (Pic) has extended in the last years, and has become essential to maintain strawberry production in Southern Spain, the main producer within the EU. However, their uncertain effects on the environment have become a new obstacle for their future use, and scientific evaluation of their toxicity is necessary to assess their impact on the environment. In this paper, we use the nematode assemblage as indicator of the effects of 1,3-D, Pic and 1,3-D + Pic on non-target soil fauna, and to infer their effects on soil food web functioning, in two commercial strawberry farms in Southern Spain. Although affected, the abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes did not differ among treatments due to compensatory growth of opportunistic nematodes. Fungal-feeding nematodes were strongly reduced by the fumigants, probably due to direct fumigants toxicity and to alterations on the fungal decomposition channel. Taxa richness and soil food web indices were also affected by the treatments. The ratio fungal to bacterial-feeding nematode abundances is proposed as the best indicator of the short and medium term effects of fumigants on non-target soil organisms.

We hypothesized that soil diversity must be well preserved because the Andalusian olive groves are low-input and no-till systems. Soil depth should also help to structure soil diversity. We tested the effect of site features and soil management on nematode diversity, soil properties and soil food webs. Site features included use, position, orientation, radiation, slope, altitude and regional scale. Soil management included tillage and herbicide use. Results show that at the large scale, nematode abundance and soil food web structure were reduced under the tree canopy affected by herbicides by 57.9 and 14.2 %, respectively, in comparison to areas not treated with herbicides. Nematode abundance decreased by 47.7 %, taxa richness by 12.4 % and soil food web structure by 23.4 % in areas where herbicides are applied, in comparison to surrounding oak woodlands. The absence of vegetation in bare soils impacted the lower levels of the soil food web, depleting bacterial and fungal-mediated decomposition channels. This depletion spread up in turn to microbivore nematodes and nematodes in the upper level. We also found that nematode abundances decreased with soil depth on average by 73.2 % from the top soil layer (0-2 cm) to the deepest one (10-20 cm), irrespectively of the tillage practice."

The TME experiment was designed to provide data that fulfill the requirements of the revised European regulation on plant protection products (regulation 1107/2009/EEC replacing guideline 91/414/EC) with a focus on structural endpoints such as soil organisms and their community structure in case higher-tier evaluation is triggered. The key objective was to evaluate the dynamics and stability of species-diverse microarthropod communities of undisturbed grassland over at least 1 year after application. In grassland soils, less selection pressure towards insensitive species compared to arable land was presumed. Sufficient numbers of organisms and numerous TME replicates ensured that a statistical evaluation could be performed to estimate the sensitivity of the organisms upon application of lindane applied at high rates of 7.5 and 75 kg ai/ha. The application rates resulted in nominal concentrations of 10 and 100 mg ai/kg dry soil referred to the top 5 cm soil layer of 10 TME each; 20 untreated TME served as controls and were used to study the natural dynamics and the variability of populations under field conditions. Results showed that the grassland from which the soil cores were sampled contained communities of soil organisms marked by typical diversity of improved grassland. Lindane applied at excessive rates caused clear dose-related and long-lasting effects on the communities of microarthropods. On the contrary, lumbricids, the total feeding activity (bait lamina) and the growth of plant biomass were not affected up to 1 year after application. Based on the results of this study using a toxic reference insecticide, the methodology seems to be suitable for use in the regulatory context of the assessment of pesticides once protection goals, data requirements and the conceptual framework are defined."

We used a hierarchical sampling design in the polluted area for studying possible scale-dependent variability in parameters measured, distance between the samples (different scales) being 5, 50 and 500 cm. Distribution of metals was moderately heterogeneous in the polluted soil; coefficient of variances (CV), 26% for Cu and 32% for Ni. Instead, distribution of enchytraeids in the area was highly heterogeneous (CV, 135%) and the variability increased with increasing a distance between the samples: CV increased from 67 to 104% from the smallest to the largest sampling scale. Soil metal concentrations did not correlate with enchytraeid densities in the polluted area. However, three out of our four sampling plots having distance of 500 cm between each other had lower enchytraeid density than the reference area. Results may indicate that C. sphagnetorum has quite low sensitivity to metal pollution, at least on the forest stand scale. On the other hand, enchytraeids may have population dynamics connected to patches (sources-sinks) caused by uneven distribution of metals. This can mitigate the effects of metals on their population densities. Due to importance of enchytraeids in decomposition processes and the fact that usually only one enchytraeid species is present in boreal coniferous forests, they may be appropriate for field monitoring in these humus rich soils.

Four sites (meadows) were selected in a downwind direction from the factory: site A was located 0.85 km far from the factory, and the other sites were maintained in approximately 2-km intervals from each other. Chemical analysis of soil samples showed low concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), with all values being under Slovak limit concentrations of heavy metals in soils.

To assess the effects of these interactions we compared nematode communities, known for their bioindication abilities, from four types of disturbed and undisturbed biotopes (coniferous forest, permanent grassland, agricultural field, clearings), where the main stress agent was represented by long-term acidic industrial emissions containing heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, and Pb). To understand the ecological interactions taking place in studied biotopes, we studied abiotic factors (soil properties) and biotic factors (vegetation, nematode communities). Except significant increase in metals total and mobile concentrations in disturbed biotopes soil, we found acidification of soil horizon, mainly in the clearings (pH= 3.68), due to SO2 precipitation. These factors has caused in clearings degradation of native phytocoenoses and decrease in decomposition rate characterized by high amount of organic matter (C-ox = 4.29%). Nematodes reacts to these conditions by shifts in trophic structure (bacteriovores to fungal feeders), increase in c-p 2 genera (Aphelenchoides, Acrobeloides, and Cephalobus), absence of sensitive groups (c-p 3-5, omnivores, predators), and decrease in ecological indices (SI, MI, MI2-5, H').

The most toxic element with a significant degradation of community structure was chromium (low mobile), which negatively affected almost all observed ecological parameters (abundance, diversity and ecological indices). On the other hand, cadmium and arsenic influence was negligible even in the plots treated with the highest concentrations and the communities resembled to the control samples. Copper showed a stimulative effect on the community under low concentration (40 mg.kg(-1)), while under higher concentrations the stimulation was replaced by stress responses.

The density of Acari and Collembola significantly decreased with the increase in concentration of Cr, Mn, Zn, Cd and Pb. Mites appeared to be more sensitive to heavy metal pollution than springtails. Likewise, the density of these microarthropoda was lower in those soils exhibiting higher nitrogen content.

Manipulations of the soil food web were carried out at two contrasting subarctic sites, a low altitude heath and a high altitude fellfield. The amount of nutrients and energy in the soil was increased by NPK fertilization and addition of labile carbon (sugar). Additionally, two bactericides (penicillin and streptomycin) and a fungicide (benomyl) were applied to manipulate the bacterial and fungal biomass. Experiments were carried out in a factorial design with repeated additions over four growing seasons. The present study investigates the effects of the manipulations on the composition of the nematode fauna. It focuses on diversity and trophic structure and their relationships with soil processes. The application of bactericides had no effect on the nematode fauna, probably due to a high adsorption or low persistence of the antibiotics in the soil, as indicated by a comparable lack of response of target organisms (i.e. bacteria). Generally, the other manipulations caused a shift in dominance structure with an increase in general opportunists and a decrease in K-strategists. This was reflected in a reduction of the maturity index. Similarly, species number, richness and diversity declined, and those effects were most pronounced in treatments with the fungicide benomyl, which was revealed to be a strong toxin to non-target organisms. In contrast to the distinct changes in species structure, the trophic structure was only moderately affected by the manipulations. Relating these findings to the estimates of functional properties at the sites (e.g. microbial biomass, plant growth) indicates considerable redundancy among the nematode fauna. The impact of the perturbations on the nematode populations was most severe at the climatically harsh high altitude fellfield, probably as a result of the lower initial biodiversity (i.e. redundancy) at that site.

Dung pats prepared from the dung of the ivermectin-treated cattle were exposed in the field from day 0 onwards in parallel with dung pats that were prepared from the dung of untreated cattle and that was either spiked with a high concentration of ivermectin (positive control) or not spiked (negative control). Ivermectin concentrations in freshly excreted dung ranged from 0.31 to 0.81 mg ivermectin kg(-1) dung dry weight. Ivermectin soil concentrations were highest below ivermectin-spiked dung in the uppermost soil layer with up to 0.085 mg ivermectin kg(-1) soil dw. No ivermectin-related effects on collembolans and mites were found. A significant decrease in the abundance of adult dung beetles was observed at 0.81 mg ivermectin kg(-1) dung dw, but the two most abundant species showed contrasting responses. For the dung beetle species, Volinus distinctus, a no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and a median effect concentration (EC(50)) of 0.50 and 0.62 mg ivermectin kg(-1) dung dw, respectively, were determined. Dung fly larvae were the most sensitive dung fauna group as their abundance was significantly reduced in all ivermectin treatments, resulting in a NOEC of <0.31 mg ivermectin kg(-1) dw. Staphylinid beetles were abundant in the dung, but apparently not affected by ivermectin. Dung from ivermectin-treated cattle degraded more slowly than dung from untreated cattle, resulting in a NOEC of <0.78 mg ivermectin kg(-1) dung dw for this functional endpoint. Adult dung beetles of both dominant species were attracted to dung pats spiked with ivermectin. The mobility of ivermectin appeared to differ between dung from ivermectin-treated cattle and dung spiked with ivermectin. This finding challenges approaches to assess the fate and effect of veterinary pharmaceuticals in higher tier tests by using spiked dung. This field study detected consistent results regarding effects of ivermectin on structural and functional endpoints in the dung compartment but effects on soil microarthropods are of little relevance in comparison.

Certain anthropogenic soils, with a low fertility level and often contaminated, ended up underused and derelict. Although derelict for humans, these soils may be refuges for biodiversity, but their biological functioning remains poorly understood. To this end, a trait-based approach of soil invertebrate communities might be an effective predictor of ecosystem state. The present work aims to highlight the in situ links between the abiotic characteristics of derelict soils and the taxonomic and functional structure and composition (through a trait-based approach) of macrofauna and Collembola communities inhabiting these soils. We studied 6 different derelict soils: two soils from coking plants, one soil from a settling pond, two constructed soils, and an inert waste storage soil. We measured fifteen abiotic soil parameters that inform on fertility and contamination. We took into account sixteen traits and ecological preferences to characterize the functional structure and composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities. Soil fertility (organic matter content, C:N ratio, P, Ca and Mg concentrations, cation-exchange capacity, and clay content) and moderate contamination (Pb, Cd, Zn, and PAH concentrations) altered the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities by selecting traits such as body length, pigmentation, vertical distribution, diet type, and habitat preference. Compost-amended constructed soil properties selected taxonomic and functional community composition of slightly disturbed soil. In contrast, metal-contaminated constructed soil harbored a higher proportion of Collembola displaying the traits and ecological preferences of instable ecosystems. The study of functional profiles of Collembola and macrofauna communities in the derelict soils evidenced that they support different communities with more or less wide functional potential. It underlines the interest of multiple biotic component studies to reach a better ecosystem description."

Derelict soils have low fertility, can be contaminated, and many of them remain unused. However, with the increasing demand of soil surfaces, they might be considered as a resource, for example for non-food biomass production. The study of their physico-chemical properties and of their biodiversity and biological activity may provide indications for their potential re-use. The objective of our study was to investigate the quality of six derelict soils, considering abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters. We studied (i) the soil bacteria, fungi, meso- and macro-fauna and plant communities of six different derelict soils (two from coking plants, one from a settling pond, two constructed ones made from different substrates and remediated soil, and an inert waste storage one), and (ii) their decomposition function based on the decomposer trophic network, enzyme activities, mineralization activity, and organic pollutant degradation. Biodiversity levels in these soils were high, but all biotic parameters, except the mycorrhizal colonization level, discriminated them. Multivariate analysis showed that biotic parameters co-varied more with fertility proxies than with soil contamination parameters. Similarly, functional parameters significantly co-varied with abiotic parameters. Among functional parameters, macro-decomposer proportion, enzyme activity, average mineralization capacity, and microbial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders were useful to discriminate the soils. We assessed their quality by combining abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters: the compost-amended constructed soil displayed the highest quality, while the settling pond soil and the contaminated constructed soil displayed the lowest. Although differences among the soils were highlighted, this study shows that derelict soils may provide a biodiversity ecosystem service and are functional for decomposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For decades, the use of so-called fumigants (=general biocides) has been a common practice for controlling soil pathogens, including plant-parasitic nematodes. Due to their adverse environmental impact, many fumigants have been banned. Biofumigation - a possible alternative - encompasses the incorporation of mulched Brassicaceous debris into topsoil, and its mode of action is based on the conversion of glucosinolates (GSLs) into nematicidal isothiocyanates (ITCs). Contrary to the relatively well-characterized impact of biofumigation on plant-parasitic nematodes, the effects on the non-parasitic part of the community is largely unknown. We investigated the field effects of biofumigation with four Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) cultivars on both plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes. Prior to biofumigation, GSL contents of B. juncea were determined, and from this, the expected ITC concentrations in the topsoil were calculated. As positive controls, two concentrations of 2-propenyl ITC - corresponding to the average expected ITC concentration, and two times the concentration predicted for the highest producer - were directly applied to wheat (=non Brassica control) plots. Although biofumigation resulted in significant changes for most nematode taxa, none of these shifts could be attributed to the release of ITCs. Moreover, none of the two directly applied ITC concentrations resulted in effects on the nematode community distinct from the water control. We therefore conclude that the observed changes in nematode assemblages are related to intense mechanical disturbance, green manure and the absence of host plants for obligatory plant-parasitic nematodes, rather than to the release of ITCs.

At levels of 553 mg Cu kg(-1), 90% avoidance of orchard soil was observed. The worms showed preference for the soils in the order; uncontaminated field derived soil > OECD standard soil > Cu contaminated orchard soil. It was demonstrated that OECD standard soil was less favoured by worms than control soil derived from the test sites. While Cu was found to be the primary influence on worm avoidance in orchard soil, other factors, such as elevated soil Zn concentrations, could not be discounted. In a corresponding field study, it was shown that earthworms occurred at lower density in orchard soils with a history of Cu fungicide use. In one such orchard, soil Cu concentrations of up to 270 mg kg(-1) were determined and no earthworms were found, while nearby control sites and less contaminated sites within the orchard had up to 40.7 g m(-2) earthworm biomass.

We focus on these organism groups as bioindicators of long-term anthropogenic disturbances of various origins categorized as two contamination levels: 1) moderate level that integrates the effects of sulphate-rich mining water contamination and alkaline air pollution that affected the area in the 1980s; 2) mild level that has been affected only by the alkaline air pollution. Additionally, the oribatid mite and diatom communities of these two groups of study sites were compared to another study area, which has similar natural conditions but is uninfluenced by these anthropogenic pollutants. Changes in oribatid mite abundance and the presence or absence of specific diatom species were the most significant differences in comparison of the two contamination levels and the area with very low human impact. Based on the community dissimilarities, both bioindicators had difficulty differentiating between the contamination levels when viewed separately. However, when the community data of the two groups were pooled, their ability to indicate the studied contamination levels improved noticeably. The sulphate-rich mining water contamination showed no strong influence on the communities, therefore the full indicative potential of these two groups may not have been reached. Nevertheless, this study provided new information about the soil communities inhabiting riparian areas and through that helped us understand some of the dynamics in diatom and oribatid mite communities brought on by long-term but weak disturbances. Some promising species were proposed from both groups that might help predict the effects of sulphate-rich mining water contamination or alkaline air pollution.

Earthworm abundance was significantly reduced at total Cu concentrations at and above 176 mg kg(-1), while nematode and enchytraeid abundances were sensitive to Cu and high Zn concentrations. Correspondingly, litter decomposition was lower in Zn and Cu treatments although there was no direct relationship between decomposition and soil invertebrate abundance or diversity. Such enduring changes in both soil biodiversity and biological activity around the current UK regulatory limits warrant further investigation to determine whether they indicate detrimental damage to soil functioning over the long-term."

Populus selections are ideal for such systems given their fast growth, extensive root systems, and high water usage rates. Maintaining ecological sustainability (i.e., the capacity for an ecosystem to maintain its function and retain its biodiversity over time) during tree establishment and development is an important component of plantation success, especially for belowground faunal populations. To determine the impact of solid waste leachate on soil micro- and mesofauna, we compared soil from eight different Populus clones receiving municipal solid waste landfill leachate irrigation with clones receiving fertilized (N, P, K) well water irrigation. Microfauna (i.e., nematodes) communities were more diverse in control soils. Mesofauna (i.e., insects) were associated with all clones; however, they were four times more abundant around trees found within the control plot than those that received leachate treatments. Nematode and insect abundance varied among Populus clones yet insect diversity was greater in the leachate-treated soils. Phytotechnologies must allow for soil faunal sustainability, as upsetting this balance could lead to great reductions in phytotechnology efficacy."

Invertebrate densities were generally reduced in carbofuran-treated plots, although individual weights of surviving macroarthropod herbivores increased significantly (p < 0.05). Carbofuran failed to affect estimates of above- or belowground plant biomass after two years of treatment. Changes in resource quantity and quality resulted in rapid responses by dominant invertebrate consumer populations.

Results show that metal pollution is not a dominating factor determining the species diversity and densities of earthworms. Remarkable differences in the distribution of ecological groups were found between biotope types. The endogeic species (Aporrectodea caliginosa Savigny, Aporrectodea rosea Savigny, Allolobophora chlorotica Savigny, Octolasion cyaneum Savigny) dominate in field and grassland habitats. The anecic species (Lumbricus terrestris L., Aporrectodea longa Ude), however, appear mostly in grassland. Epigeic species (Lumbricus rubellus Hoffmeister, Lumbricus castaneus Savigny, Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny) are found exclusively (in addition to the other two life forms) in grassland and the forest habitats. Differences in earthworm biomass between monitoring sites are not related to ecological risk assessment. These differences may be largely dependant on soil properties e.g. pH and organic matter. A matrix with the ecological requirements of earthworm species was developed."

While the importance of soil fauna is well recognized, quantitative estimates of the role of soil fauna on soil biogeochemical processes, such as plant litter decomposition, are limited by methodological constraints. The addition of naphthalene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (C10H8), to suppress soil fauna has been used for decades in decomposition experiments, but its efficacy remains questioned. In fact, we lack a rigorous field assessment of the efficacy of naphthalene additions for soil fauna suppression and potential nontarget effects on the soil microbial community and carbon cycling. We added naphthalene at a high rate (477 g m(-2)) monthly for 23 months on the bare soil surface of a tallgrass prairie. We determined the effect of such additions on the abundance of nematodes and micro-arthropods along the soil profile to a depth of 20 cm at 11, 16 and 23 months after initiating naphthalene application. We used the variation in the natural C-13 abundance of the naphthalene (delta C-13 - 25.5%.) as compared to the native soil (delta C-13 similar to -17%.) to quantify naphthalene contribution to soil CO2 efflux and microbial biomarkers (PLFA). Naphthalene addition significantly reduced the abundance of oribatid mites (-45%), predatory mites (-52%) and springtails (-49%), but did not affect nematode abundance. The C-13 abundance of a few Gram-negative (cy17:0, 18:1 omega 7c, 16:1 omega 7c), Gram-positive.(a15:0, i15:0) and Actinobacteria (10Me-16:0, 10Me-18:0) PLFA markers decreased significantly in naphthalene treated plots, indicating bacterial utilization of naphthalene-derived C. Mixing models showed this contribution to be highly variable, with the highest naphthalene-C incorporation for Gram negative bacteria. Naphthalene-C was not incorporated in fungal PLFAs. This microbial utilization did not affect overall microbial abundance, community structure or activity, estimated as soil respiration. This experiment proves that naphthalene addition is a feasible method to reduce soil micro-arthropods in the field, with negligible direct effects on soil nematodes, microbial abundance and C dynamics.

Two different spills in the same area with different initial hydrocarbon concentrations (33,500 mg kg(-1) and 4,800 mg kg(-1)) were compared. At the higher initial hydrocarbon concentration fertilizer addition increased the rate of bioremediation (first-order rate constant of 0.0033 days(-1) with fertilizer amendment vs. 0.0020 days(-1) without) and resulted in more rapid recovery of soil bacteria (numbers, community structure, diversity) and nematodes (trophic diversity and community structure). The effect of the fertilizer amendment was more significant at the higher initial concentration of crude oil hydrocarbons, presumably due to greater depletion of soil nutrient pools in the absence of the amendment. A second objective of this work was to identify, sensitive and cost-effective ecological indicators useful for monitoring the recovery of soil ecosystems impacted by crude oil. Ecological indicators used included: microbial numbers, community, structure, and activity as revealed by biomarker analysis (phospholipid fatty acids); nitrogen availability; nematode numbers and community structure (trophic groups and colonizer-persister classes); and ultimately, plant cover and diversity. All ecological indicators investigated were sensitive to disturbances in the soil food web in a hydrocarbon-impacted site. However, nematode community structure analysis offered the greatest sensitivity coupled with low cost and readily available sources for the analysis."

No worms were collected from the two sites closest to the factory (<0.6 km) and catches were significantly lower than controls at a further five sites (<3 km). 3. Seasonal composition of sampled communities differed only for summer with lower numbers of individuals and species collected at all sites. Reduced catches in the summer sample is a response to drought. 4. Species richness was lowest at sites close to the factory. For example, worms such as Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny) and Allolobophora chlorotica (Savigny) that were dominant at relatively clean sites further from the smelter are absent from the most contaminated soils. 5. Reduced species richness resulted in lower Shannon-Weiner diversity and higher Berger-Parker dominance. Multivariate cluster analysis for spring, summer and winter indicated that sites could be split into three groups based upon relative species composition. In autumn, two clusters were identified. 6. The absence of sensitive species from sites close to the smelting works supports the inclusion of earthworms as a key group in a terrestrial prediction and classification scheme for quantifying the effects of pollutants on soil biodiversity.

Total earthworm density was found to be inversely related to concentrations of metals in soils. Some species of earthworms were found to be more 'sensitive' to metals and were absent from sites where more 'tolerant' species persisted. For example, Lumbricus rubellus, Lumbricus castaneus and Lumbricus terrestris were all present at sites close to the smelter where Aporrectodea rosea, Aporrectodea caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica were absent. The first three 'tolerant' species have more active calcium secretion glands in their gut than the three 'sensitive' worms. Calcium is known to be involved in the sequestration and elimination of various metals through the chlorogogenous tissue. Toxicity tests were carried out with a 'sensitive' and a 'non-sensitive' earthworm species (Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea rosea respectively) to examine if earthworm species distribution could be related to their susceptibility to the metals. In addition, the OECD recommended species Eisenia fetida was tested, to compare the sensitivity of this worm to the two commonly occurring soil species. Zinc was the metal used for these tests, since earlier comparisons of metal toxicity between the laboratory and field have shown that of the four metals released from the smelting works (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), it is zinc that is limiting the distribution of worms. Test results indicated that Aporrectodea rosea is more sensitive to the effects of zinc than Lumbricus rubellus. Thus, it appears that differences in the distribution of species of earthworms around the smelter can be related to variation in sensitivity to zinc. Both species were affected by zinc at lower concentrations than Eisenia fetida."

We found that the dominant groups were Prostigmata, Oribatida, and Gamasina mites and the collembolan families Isotomidae and Entomobryidae. Results showed that the composition of the soil fauna communities differed significantly among the habitats with different salinity. Number and density of taxa were lower in communities with high salinity. The highest number of taxa (66) was found on the Artemisia anethifolia sites, the lowest number (47) on the Alkali patches. The Shannon-Wiener index was the lowest on the Alkali patches, whereas the Simpson-dominance index was the highest in these habitats. The number and density of taxa changed during the seasons. The soil fauna tended to gather on soil's surface. According to the Redundancy analysis, the soil organic matter positively affected the density of the soil fauna and soil fauna decreased with increasing degree of salinization in Songnen Grasslands."

The activity of heavy metals in soil solution was determined at each sampling. In terms of management, pasture conditions in 1999 and 2000 were most settled, and while the activities of Cu, Ni, and Zn explained some 44% of variance in total nematodes, there were few significant correlations between nematode genera and individual heavy metals. Both Cu and Zn depressed nematode diversity (H') and the decomposition index. There were, however, no consistent effects on any nematode functional group. Over the 5 years sampled there were few consistent correlations between soil nematodes and heavy metal activity, the greatest being significant depression of H' by Zn in 3 years. There was no effect on the total maturity index. Although the few significant effects may reflect the relatively low heavy metal activities, a detailed analysis of heavy metal impact on the nematode assemblage, and thus its contribution to soil processes, would require relating the 6 functional groups to their food resources in the various plots."

Red mud (wet storage solution) can be regarded as a complex mixture of contaminants due to its extreme alkalinity and the presence of potentially toxic trace elements. After-effect investigations on soil properties and soil microarthropods were carried out in three distinct habitat types (agricultural land, grassland, woodland) in the red mud affected area. Soils in the red mud affected area were moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 7.5 to 8.5). Total content of trace metals Cd, Ni, Cr exceeded threshold concentrations for soil. Acari and Collembola were by far the most abundant taxa, while important groups like Pauropoda, Protura and Symphyla were completely absent from the samples of red mud affected plots. These observations were also reflected by the low values of the soil biological quality (QBS-ar) index. Independently of habitat types, total collembolan abundance tended to be lower in the contaminated area when compared with nearby control samples. Typical species distribution of Collembola communities in the contaminated area generally included one or two very common and abundant species and more, relatively rare species of low abundance. In the red mud affected open habitats, a distinct eudominance of Brachystomella parvula and Parisotoma notabilis was observed; whereas in contaminated woodland Parisotoma notabilis formed the bulk of the community with Sphaeridia pumilis, Folsomia manolachei and F. quadrioculata being subdominant. Species sensitive to alkalinity and red mud components (e.g. Hypogastrura vernalis, Lepidocyrtus tomosvaryi) were completely absent or were present only in limited numbers in the contaminated samples.

Nearby unpolluted control plots of each habitat types were selected for comparative purposes. Analyses revealed that soil became strongly alkaline and, even nine months after the disaster, pH exceeded a value of 9.0 in the polluted forests. Water soluble Na content found to be 50-160 times greater in the polluted area, and total content of metals (e.g. Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) also increased considerably. Nevertheless, owing to the high alkalinity and red mud's adsorption capacity, bioavailable forms of heavy metals were lower in comparison to the acid control soils. Collembola species richness was about the same in the polluted and control forests (31 and 32, respectively), but lower in the polluted meadows compared to the control plots (21 and 27, respectively). Total community abundance changed differently in the open habitat and in the forest. Its value dropped by 45% in the polluted meadows, while almost tripled in the polluted forests. Changes in the abundance of individual species involved both decrease/elimination of sensitive species (e.g. Isotomiella minor, Sminthurinus aureus) and displacement of species tolerant to pollution (e.g. Micranurida pygmaea) into higher abundance classes. Certain species (e.g. Folsomia manolachei, Sphaeridia pumilis), following the pollution, showed a reverse pattern of abundance in the two habitat types; increasing in the forest while decreasing in the meadow. This study has suggested that soil alkalinity and salt (Na) toxicity were presumably the two most important factors determining the structure of Collembola communities in the area affected by red mud pollution. Despite the high toxicity risk associated with this accident, no adverse effect has been observed in Collembola abundance. Nevertheless, as a consequence of soil re-acidification, re-mobilisation of fixed metals may occur in the long term, constituting to a potential risk to soil Collembola. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The nematodes were determined down to the genus and were assigned to five feeding groups. Total nematode numbers were highest in the site treated with sewage sludge and heavy metals. The smallest total numbers were found in the control site. The plant-feeding nematode genera showed different patterns of abundance depending on the sludge treatment and heavy metal content. For the mycophagic and bacteriophagic nematodes, numbers increased with the amount of sludge, especially in the sites with a higher heavy metal content. The family Rhabditidae was the most numerous group in the sludge plus heavy metals treatment.

Sites contaminated by mainly diesel fuels are undergoing remediation by the Australian Antarctic Division. The risks posed by these sites are being managed using a weight of evidence approach, for which this study provides a preliminary line of evidence for the ecological assessment component of this site management decision framework. This knowledge is pertinent, given the absence of environmental guidelines for fuel contaminants in subantarctic ecosystems. We provide a field-based, site-specific ecological risk assessment for soil invertebrate communities across the fuel spill sites, before the commencement of in situ remediation activities. Springtails (Collembola) were the most abundant taxa. Springtail community patterns showed only limited correlations with the level of fuel contamination at the soil surface, even when elevated levels occurred in the substratum layers. Of the environmental variables measured, community patterns were most strongly correlated with vegetation cover. We identify a suite of 6 species that contribute most to the community dynamics across these sites. A subset of these we propose as useful candidates for future development of single-species toxicity tests: Folsomotoma punctata, Cryptopygus caecus, Cryptopygus antarcticus and Parisotoma insularis. Findings from this study advance our understanding of soil invertebrate community dynamics within these contaminated sites, directly contributing to the improved management and restoration of the sites. Not only does this study provide an important line of evidence for the island's ecological risk assessment for fuel contaminants, it also enhances our understanding of the potential impact of fuels at other subantarctic islands.

In this paper we attempt to simultaneously assess the functional and taxonomic structure of various components of this food-web. Biota in the perennial system was the most responsive to disturbance. The microflora was strongly influenced by mulching, and through tritrophic effects caused increases in top predatory but not most microbe-feeding nematodes. These effects have become increasingly apparent as the study has progressed and, in the asparagus site, have worked their way down the soil profile over time. Cultivation in the asparagus site caused large increases in bacterial-feeding nematodes, probably due to the high weed levels which developed during the winter months under that treatment. Evidence appears to exist for a cascade effect operating due to top down effects of nematodes on lower trophic levels. Ordination analysis of the nematode data demonstrated that nematode populations were more closely related to the state of environmental factors at earlier samplings than at contemporary samplings, and that the linkages between the nematode and environmental data sets strengthened over time. For both the nematode and soil-associated beetle data distinct assemblages of organisms were found in the mulched plots; distinct assemblages of nematode genera also emerged in the cultivated asparagus plots after two years. The soil-associated macrofauna was usually linked to high weed and surface organic residue levels. Species diversity of soil associated nematodes was not particularly responsive to disturbance while that of the soil-associated beetles was strongly enhanced by mulching and (sometimes) high weed levels. Approaches based on either functional group or species composition data emerged in our study as reasonably sensitive indicators for assessing the response of the soil biota to disturbance."

Seven earthworm species belonging to three families (Megascolecidae, Moniligastridae, and Lumbricidae) were present. Correlations between earthworm densities or biomass and a range of soil physical and chemical parameters were generally poor; however, several linear regression models based on the soil physicochernical characteristics and metal concentrations in earthworm bodies were established for each metal (Cu, Cd, and Zn) and each earthworm family.

RESULTSMicrobial activity and culturable bacterial counts were significantly higher under fully organic management. Culturable fungi, actinomycete and nematode counts showed a consistent trend towards higher numbers under fully organic management but these data were not statistically significant. No differences were found in the fungal/bacterial ratio. DGGE banding patterns and sequencing of excised bands showed clear differences between treatments. Putative onion fungal pathogens were predominantly sequenced under conventional soil treatment practices whilst putative soil suppressive bacterial species were predominantly sequenced from the organic pest-control treatment plots.

This cropping system involved a 2 year rotation of upland rice the first year, followed by common bean the second year, with oat as a relay crop under both conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage soil management (NT), each under both organic (OF) and mineral fertilization (IVIF). All four modalities (CT-OF; CT-MF; NT-OF and NT-MF) were managed under two plant protection levels (seed dressing with imidacloprid + thiram vs no seed dressing). Herbivorous/detritivorous beetles were the most abundant soil biota, respectively representing more than.two-thirds and half of all macrofauna at the outset of the experiment and 4 years later, with the BB Heteronychus orator rugifrons (Fairmaire) being the dominant pest species (herbivore). The Shannon diversity index was reduced significantly between the beginning and the end of the experiment 4 years later, while it was only marginally affected by soil management, fertilization and seed dressing regimes at both sampling dates. Throughout the study period, seed dressing resulted in a significant reduction in BB damage, and in a significantly higher rice grain yield as compared to control. NT management did not enable seed dressing discontinuation based on grain yield and BB damage level after 3 and 4 years of this practice, respectively. In this respect, CT-MF management ranked best in the absence of seed dressing. The reasons for the poor performance of NT management in the studied cropping system as compared to the same strategy used in other systems reported in earlier studies are discussed.

The observed changes in the soil properties of the most contaminated areas suggest that the contamination may be disturbing processes of decomposition and nutrient mineralisation. Also two functionally important groups of soil organisms, microbes (as analysed using the PLFA analysis) and enchytraeid worms, were negatively affected by the contamination. Furthermore, there was an indication of reduced pine litter production at the contaminated areas. On the other hand, lead contamination appears not to have affected pine growth or soil-dwelling nematodes and microarthropods, and the general outlook of the whole ecosystem is that of a healthy forest. Thus, the boreal forest ecosystem studied as a whole appears to bear strong resistance to contamination, despite negative effects of lead on many of its components. This resistance may result from e.g. low bioavailability of lead, avoidance of the most contaminated soil horizons and microsites by the organisms, and functional redundancy and development of lead-tolerant populations amongst the organisms. The relative importance of these factors and the mechanisms behind them will be investigated in forthcoming studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Study plots in southeastern Kentucky were aerially sprayed one time in May of 1997; control plots received no insecticide. In 1997 and 1998 we sampled arthropods in strata ranging from ground level to the forest canopy, Here we report the effects of the treatments on ground- and litter-dwelling arthropods. Gypsy moth suppression tactics negatively impacted litter-dwelling mites and thrips, with populations in diflubenzuron-treated plots significantly lower relative to untreated controls in the year of application. The abundance of predatory spiders and rove beetles was also affected by treatment applications. Treatment effects were evident 1 year post-application for populations of thrips, spiders, bark/ambrosia beetles, millipedes, and centipedes. The highly clustered distribution patterns of many arthropods, as well as variable weather patterns, may have confounded the effects of our treatments.

When animals were able to escape from the herbicide through a perforated wall separating two compartments filled with natural soil, the behavior of collembolan communities exhibited interactive (non-additive) effects of humus type and herbicide application. The combination of an acid soil (supposedly providing greater tolerance to organic pollutants) with a neutral soil, increased biodiversity of Collembola, but caused the disappearance of some acido-sensitive species, pointing to complex relationships between pesticides, soils and soil organisms.

Sampling included three paired sites containing areas where herbicides and mechanical means had been employed and which were still dominated by leafy spurge, and areas where herbicides had not been applied and where very little (< 0.03%) or no leafy spurge or Canada thistle existed. Plant species diversity, frequency, and percent cover were estimated. Decomposition rates were assessed by use of litterbags placed on the sites and retrieved after I year. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum potential was used as an index for mutualistic associations. Soil microarthropod densities were used as an index for the detrital food web. Significantly greater (P <= 0.05) richness of plant species and significantly higher percent relative cover of herbs, sedges, lichen, moss, and fallen litter was found on non-invasive plots compared to plots with invasive species. Plots where herbicides had been applied, and which still possessed leafy spurge, showed a significantly higher percentage of bare ground. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential did not differ between plots. Overall soil arthropod densities and densities of specific suborders of Acari were significantly lower (P <= 0.05) in invasive species plots. There was no significant difference in decomposition rates between non-invasive and invasive plots, but there were site differences in losses of lignin, phosphorus, and trace elements from litter placed on invasive and non-invasive plots. When differences were observed, loss rates were always less in invasive plots. Our results indicate that the establishment of leafy spurge and Canada thistle and the subsequent management practices to control them has altered the plant community structure by facilitating the establishment of other exotic species, which has resulted in a change in the composition and functioning of the belowground community.

During the 36 month study, soil core samples were dominated by mites (49%) and springtails (28%). A total of 19 taxonomic groups were suitable for statistical analysis. We detected no significant treatment effects based on total organism counts or counts by trophic categories (p < 0.05). There were no significant treatment effects for populations of major taxonomic groups, except for Araneae (spiders). Analysis of leaf litter bags also showed no significant differences in total numbers of invertebrates or in trophic categories between treated and reference watersheds during the 12 month post-treatment study. Density of one species of springtail (Sminthurus purpurescens) and springtails as a group were significantly lower in treated watersheds. High variation was associated with both soil core and leaf bag samples; because of this variation, a significance level of 0.05 should be considered very conservative. Long-term trends in soil biota were evident, demonstrating the need for well-established pre-treatment baseline data for pesticide impacts on soil organisms."

In addition to copper, the influence of several soil characteristics and plant cover data on soil microarthropod abundance and distribution was tested. Total microarthropod abundance was highest at intermediate copper concentrations, and linearly related to grass biomass. For single species populations no clear picture of abundance in relation to soil copper was seen. Two collembolan species, Folsomia quadrioculata and Folsomia fimetaria, were among the most sensitive. The Shannon-Wiener index of biodiversity decreased linearly with increasing soil copper concentrations. The application of multivariate statistics showed copper to be the parameter best fitting the distribution of microarthropod species in the field. A distinction could be made between sampling points with 50-199 mg Cu/kg soil and those with higher copper concentrations. The species composition of the microarthropod community was not correlated with plant species diversity or total grass biomass, but was affected by a nearby row of tall trees. Community analysis of field data proved as sensitive as laboratory testing, and seemed superior to single species field population data concerning detection of copper effects on soil microarthropods."

Long-residual activity and application before feasible scouting probably lead to its overuse and overexposure. Recent investigations revealed a selective impact of imidacloprid (not trichlorfon or halofenozide) on certain nontarget turf arthropods, motivating the present study on the persistence of abundance effects over 6 years of annual applications. Arthropods were sampled monthly (July to October) in replicated plots using soil core heat extraction and pitfall traps to quantify soil- and surface-active arthropods. Captures were identified to class, order or family. The most represented taxa were analysed to test for cumulative effects and their change over season and year. Imidacloprid had no impact on pitfall captures, although the abundance of Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera and Collembola was suppressed in soil core captures. Among beetles, impact was expressed in adults (not larvae), and in Carabidae and Staphylinidae (not Chrysomelidae or Curculionidae). Among springtails, impact was expressed in Entomobryomorpha (not Poduromorpha or Symphypleona). Impact did not diminish with year but there was variable recovery between applications. There may therefore be a diverging response of soil- and surface-active fauna to the nontarget impacts of imidacloprid. The suppression of predaceous (not phytophagous) beetles indicates an indirect effect mediated through declines in prey populations. The magnitude of abundance effects confirms that the balance between target and nontarget impact should be explicitly examined. Implications are discussed with respect to functional relevance for nutrient cycling and the natural regulation of pests."

Treatments were applied to replicated plots (10mx10m) from 2000 to 2002. Invertebrates were sampled monthly from July to October in 2001 and 2002 by extracting soil cores in modified Tullgren funnels. All 293,868 captures were identified to class (arthropods) and order (hexapods). Overall extraction rate was 37,772 individuals/m(2) of turf and associated topsoil. The ten most abundant taxa were analyzed in more detail to compare impacts across treatments. A consistent short-term effect due to individual. applications was not detected. But when data were examined across both seasons, a significant cumulative effect of treatment was detected for total hexapods, Collembola, Thysanoptera and Coleoptera adults, but not oribatid mites, non-oribatid mites, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera larvae or Diptera. Contrary to predictions, only imidacloprid - a systemic neonicotinoid applied early in the life cycle to target neonate white grubs - had a discernible impact on non-target abundance. Relative to the untreated check, it suppressed the abundance of those broad taxonomic groups by 54-62%.

Soil samples from five locations (named A-E), which were chosen for soil analysis, showed significant differences in their heavy metal content (p < 0.01), as well as in the variety of nematodes (up to 41 genera) and families (up to 20) that were present. The different samples also differed significantly in the total PAH content (p < 0.05), as well as the six types of PAH present. Sites A-C showed the most severe contamination with heavy metals and PAHs; these sites had the lowest abundance of fungivores and omnivore/predators, but the proportion of bacteriovores was the highest (p < 0.05). Site E, in contrast, showed only minor pollution with heavy metals and PAHs, and it contained the highest abundance of plant parasites (p < 0.05). Several nematode ecological indicators were found to correlate with concentration of soil pollutants at all the sites tested: the maturity index (MI, in addition to plant parasites), plant parasite index (PPI), I MI pound (including all the soil nematodes), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H''), and Wasilewska index (WI). Disturbance to the soil environment was more severe when MI, I MI pound, and H' values were lower. The results of the study show that the abundance and structure of the soil nematode communities in the sampling locations were strongly influenced by levels of heavy metals and PAHs in the soil. They also show that the diversity index H' and the maturity index can be valuable tools for assessing the impact of pollutants on nematodes."

Anthropogenic acid deposition-induced soil acidification is one of the major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Few studies, however, have explored in detail how above-ground changes in plant species richness and productivity resulting from soil acidification are mediated by effects on below-ground biota and soil properties. 2. To increase our understanding of this linkage, we collected data on below- and above-ground communities and soil properties in a 3-year field experiment with seven levels of acid addition rate to build-up broad intensities of soil acidification in the semi-arid Inner Mongolian grassland. 3. Acid addition directly elevated concentrations of soil Al3+ ions, decreased the base cations Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+, and increased soil moisture and available phosphorus. Acid addition also appears to have altered the soil microbial community via changes in H+ and Al3+ ions and altered the nematode community via changes in H+ ions and soil moisture. 4. The observed changes in soil N availability (i.e. net N mineralization, NO3--N and NH4+-N could be explained by mediating changes in the H+ and Al3+ ions, microbial community (i.e. community structure, bacteria and fungi/bacteria as indicated by phospholipid fatty acids analysis) and the nematode community (i.e. total abundance, taxa richness and maturity index). 5. Declines in plant species richness and productivity were greater at high intensities of soil acidification in the second sampling year than in the first sampling year. The changes in plant community observed were mostly explained by soil nutrient pathways (e.g. N availability or base mineral cations), which were in turn regulated by the soil microbial or nematode communities as well as by the direct effects of the increase in H+ or Al3+ ions. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the below-ground microbial and nematode communities are more sensitive to soil acidification than the plant communities are, and further that soil acidification-induced changes in plants are mediated by changes in below-ground communities and soil nutrients. These findings improve our understanding of the links between below- and above-ground communities in the Inner Mongolia grassland, especially in the context of anthropogenic acid enrichment."

The effects of soil contamination with the insecticide carbofuran on two geographically distinct microarthropod communities (Mediterranean and Tropical) were evaluated in their soils of origin under controlled laboratory conditions. After contamination of two agricultural soils from Portugal and Brazil, a gradient of concentrations was prepared. Soil cores were taken from the respective uncontaminated surrounding areas and the mesofauna of three cores was extracted directly to the test soil. After extracting the microarthropod communities to the test soil, these were incubated under laboratory conditions for 4 weeks, after which the mesofauna was extracted again. The organisms were assorted into higher taxonomic groups and Acari and Collembola were respectively assorted into order/sub-order/cohort and family. Collembolans were still classified according to morphological traits and used as a case-study of trait based risk assessment (TERA; Band et al 2008) of pesticides. The exposure to insecticide contamination caused the impoverishment of the taxonomic diversity in both communities. Significant shifts in the microarthropod community structure in the different carbofuran treatments were found for both soils, although effects were more pronounced in the assay performed with the soil from Brazil. Collembolans were the most affected group with a strong decline in their abundance. A dose-response relationship was observed, showing a consistent decline on the relative abundance of Isotomidae, closely followed by an increase of Entomobryidae. Contrastingly, Acari (especially Oribatida) tended to increase their numbers with higher concentrations. Trait based analysis of Collembola data suggested that a shift in the functional composition of the communities occurred due to carbofuran soil contamination and that species adapted to deeper soil layers were more vulnerable to insecticide toxicity.

The mull was contaminated with three concentrations of lead (as lead acetate) at 50, 6000 and 60,000 ppm. When combined with moder in the adjacent compartment, six times more individuals and five times more species were observed in the mull at the highest concentration applied, compared to mull combined with itself. Parisotoma notabilis proved to be highly sensitive to lead, and shifted to the moder compartment even at the lowest concentration. Densities of other mull species such as Pseudosinella alba were affected by medium to high concentrations of lead but these species did not move to the moder soil despite their high motility. Acidophilic species living in moder only, such as Willemia anophthalma, Proisotoma minima and Xenylla tullbergi, colonized contaminated mull treatments with densities increasing with lead concentrations but the result of this process was erratic. Folsomia manolachei was present in both humus forms but was much more abundant in the moder. This species colonized mull at medium to high lead concentrations, where it restored totally or partly its original abundance in the uncontaminated mull.

The soil characteristics and Collembola in these treatments were investigated for one plant growth season. The soil environment was deteriorated (as indicated by the decreased soil oxidizable organic matter, total nitrogen and soil water content and increased soil compaction) by soybean and rice cultivation treatments. The densities and species richness of Collembola significantly decreased in the rice cultivation treatments but not in the soybean cultivation treatments. For the soybean cultivation treatments, density and species richness of the soil Collembola significantly increased in the fertilizer, herbicide and fertilizer + herbicide application treatments.

Three different insecticide variants were used in the experiment: a granular application of tefiuthrin, seed treatment of clothianidin and granular application of clothianidin. In total, 39 nematode species and 35 genera were identified in the maize field. A significant impact of season was found on the relative abundance of trophic groups and all ecological and diversity indices, with the exception of nematode abundance. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) based on species diversity showed a greater difference between years than among variants. Significant differences among variants were detected for the species diversity index of trophic groups (bacterivores, fungivores and omnivores) and selected ecological indices, such as maturity and structural and basal indices. The pot experiment included the same three insecticide variants as the field experiment, as well as variants with insecticide concentrations that were five times higher than normal rate of application corresponding to control variants. Overall, 24 genera of nematodes were recorded in the pot experiment. A NMS analysis based on genera diversity separated the samples into groups by sampling date rather than by variant. A five-fold increase in the concentration of chemicals did not significantly influence the evaluated indices or trophic groups.

The numbers of nematodes in particular trophic groups (i.e., bacterial feeders, fungal feeders and omnivores) were significantly different between variant 2 and the control. The Sigma Maturity index, Maturity index and Plant parasitic index did not show significant differences among the variants.

Springtails were collected from pitfall traps and soil cores in plots planted with rootworm Bt corn and its non-Bt isoline. Few differences were observed in the abundance of individual species in Bt and isoline corn. Nor did the estimated species richness or the Shannon or Simpson diversity indices differ significantly between Bt and isoline corn at either location during 2000-2002, indicating no effect of Bt corn on springtail diversity. In soil insecticide-treated plots, however, springtails were consistently more abundant than in check plots, perhaps because of adverse insecticide effects on springtail predators. Soil insecticide also reduced both Shannon and Simpson diversity in the Iowa euedaphic and Illinois epedaphic populations. Such consistent insecticide effects on both abundance and diversity of springtails provide a positive control by which to assess the power of the experimental design to detect a comparable impact of Bt corn on springtails. They also show that insecticide use more strongly impacts springtails and their predators than does the practice of growing transgenic crops to control the same pests."

All treatments were done using both low-volume and high-volume spraying techniques to check whether any effects were dependent on the method of application. Oribatid mite communities were assessed from soil core samples collected during the growing season. Total abundance of oribatids was not different across the plots, but some species decreased in number, while one species increased. Species diversity and community equitability decreased with the application of chemical and biofungicides especially when using high-volume spraying. In control plots most oribatid species showed a significant degree of aggregation, which tended to decrease under fungicide treatment. Ridomil Plus, Plant Guard and Polyversum had a negative effect on the gravid/ungravid ratio of some species. Egg number averaged over the whole adult population was not directly related to the application of chemical and biofungicides but it showed a species-specific relationship with population density.

Flue gas desulfurization and mined gypsums were evaluated to determine their ability to affect concentrations of Hg and other trace elements in soils and earthworms.

The application rates of gypsums ranged from 2.2 Mg ha(-1) in Indiana to 20 Mg ha(-1) in Ohio and Alabama. These rates are 2 to 10 times higher than typically recommended. The lengths of time from gypsum application to soil and earthworm sampling were 5 and 18 mo in Ohio, 6 mo in Indiana, 11 mo in Alabama, and 4 mo in Wisconsin. Earthworm numbers and biomass were decreased by FGD and mined gypsums in Ohio. Among all the elements examined, Hg was slightly increased in soils and earthworms in the FGD gypsum treatments compared with the control and the mined gypsum treatments. The differences were not statistically significant except for the Hg concentration in the soil at the Wisconsin site. Selenium in earthworms in the FGD gypsum treatments was statistically higher than in the controls but not higher than in the mined gypsum treatments at the Indiana and Wisconsin sites. Bioaccumulation factors for nondepurated earthworms were statistically similar or lower for the FGD gypsum treatments compared with the controls for all elements.

Cartagena-La Union mine (Southeastern-Spain) was active for >2500 years. Despite its closure in 1991, high concentrations of metals and waste residues remain in this area. A previous study using nematodes suggested that high lead content diminished soil biodiversity. However, the effects of mine pollution on specific ecosystem services remain unknown. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) play a major role in the biocontrol of insect pests. Because EPNs are widespread throughout the world, we speculated that EPNs would be present in the mined areas, but at increased incidence with distance from the pollution focus. We predicted that the natural enemies of nematodes would follow a similar spatial pattern. We used qPCR techniques to measure abundance of five EPN species, five nematophagous fungi species, two bacterial ectoparasites of EPNs and one group of free-living nematodes that compete for the insect-cadaver. The study comprised 193 soil samples taken from mining sites, natural areas and agricultural fields. The highest concentrations of iron and zinc were detected in the mined area as was previously described for lead, cadmium and nickel. Molecular tools detected very low numbers of EPNs in samples found to be negative by insect-baiting, demonstrating the importance of the approach. EPNs were detected at low numbers in 13% of the localities, without relationship to heavy-metal concentrations. Only Acrobeloides-group nematodes were inversely related to the pollution gradient. Factors associated with agricultural areas explained 98.35% of the biotic variability, including EPN association with agricultural areas. Our study suggests that EPNs have adapted to polluted habitats that might support arthropod hosts. By contrast, the relationship between abundance of Acrobeloides-group and heavy-metal levels, revealed these taxa as especially well suited bio-indicators of soil mining pollution.

Laboratory tests with eight species of algae, two species of invertebrates (Enchytraeus crypticus and Folsomia candida), and one plant species (Sinapis alba) gave similar results and showed that besides low pH and the associated solubility of Al, As content and high conductivity were the major factors correlated with toxicity of post-mining substrates.

The toxicity tests explained about 21% of the data variability for the algal community in the field but did not explain any of the data variability for the plant or invertebrate community in the field. The poor ability of laboratory tests to predict the data obtained from surveys of natural communities may result from environmental factors and biotic interactions that have strong effects in the field but not in the laboratory.

Differences in the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn between the least and most contaminated part of the 35 metre transect were more than one order of magnitude. A gradient of Zn concentrations from 597 to 9080 mug g(-1) dry soil was found. A comparison between field concentrations of the four metals and previous studies on their relative toxicities to Collembola, suggested that Zn is likely to be responsible for any ecotoxicological effects on springtails at this site. Euedaphic ( soil dwelling) Collembola were extracted by placing soil cores into Tullgren funnels and epedaphic ( surface dwelling) species were sampled using pitfall traps. There was no obvious relationship between the total abundance, or a range of commonly used diversity indices, and Zn levels in soils. However, individual species showed considerable differences in abundance. Metal ""tolerant'' (e.g., Ceratophysella denticulata) and metal ""sensitive'' (e.g., Cryptopygus thermophilus) species could be identified. Epedaphic species appeared to be influenced less by metal contamination than euedaphic species. This difference is probably due to the higher mobility and lower contact with the soil pore water of epedaphic springtails in comparison to euedaphic Collembola. In an experiment exposing the standard test springtail, Folsomia candida, to soils from all 32 sampling points, adult survival and reproduction showed small but significant negative relationships with total Zn concentrations. Nevertheless, juveniles were still produced from eggs laid by females in the most contaminated soils with 9080 mug g(-1) Zn. Folsomia candida is much more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of Zn in the standard OECD soil. Thus, care should be taken in extrapolating the results of laboratory toxicity tests on metals in OECD soil to field soils, in which, the biological availability of contaminants is likely to be lower. Our studies have shown the importance of ecotoxicological effects at the species level. Although there may be no differences in overall abundance, sensitive species that are numerous in contaminated sites, and which may play important roles in decomposition(""keystone species'') can be greatly reduced in numbers by pollution."

Aim of the research was to relate Quercus ilex (good monitor of air pollution) leaf, litter and soil microarthropod community characteristics taking into account metal pollution and climatic conditions. The research was performed in an urban environment of the Mediterranean area. Leaves and litter were characterized for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb concentrations and for the main functional traits. The soil microarthropod community was investigated for abundance and richness as well as for habitat and diet preferences. The main results were that leaf metal accumulation and climatic condition contextually affected the litter characteristics both in terms of metal composition and morphological traits. Litter quality discriminated different microarthropod taxa assemblages according trophic preferences whereas climatic conditions strongly affected microarthropod habitat distribution.

Acarina and Collembola were the dominant taxa in both cities. In Siena the total number of arthropod individuals collected in the samples was over 1/3 greater than in Naples, but all diversity indices scored higher in Naples than in Siena, probably in response to the higher heterogeneity of microclimatic and pedological conditions found in Naples study area. Oribatids resulted twice more abundant in Siena and so were the total mites with respect to Collembola. While ""taxonomic richness"" per site increased with distance from road traffic, entropy and evenness indices scored higher at the two ends of the impact gradient in both cities. The overall variation in basic pedological and microbiological soil parameters positively correlated with the total abundance of arthropods, and negatively correlated with their taxonomic richness. At the resolution employed, no significant relation emerged between anthropogenic factors, such as traffic load and soil pollution, and the arthropod fauna density and variety. These results are consistent with conclusions drawn from a previous study on the enchytraeid fauna examined at species level, which is remarkable considering the different taxonomic resolutions of the two studies. CCA results suggest that the higher abundance of Oribatid mites, Protura and Thysanura and the lower abundance of Diplopoda and Symphyla in Siena could depend on a higher fungi/bacteria ratio. This observation can be interpreted in terms of differences in fungi and bacteria between the two cities: Siena is shifted towards the fungal decomposition channel, which supports taxa such as oribatid mites, while Naples is shifted towards the bacterial channel, which supports chiefly detritivorous groups, such as diplopods."

We approached the enchytraeid assemblages of urban holm oak stands in Naples and Siena adopting a high intensity sampling that, for the first time in the Mediterranean climate zone, would ensure that the data collected be representative of the target populations. Structural parameters (diversity and evenness, biomass, size classes, aggregation) were compared across different spatial (regional, urban district, within habitat) and temporal scales (season and year). Species richness was found to change significantly only at regional scale; background data suggest that this may depend on the higher environmental heterogeneity occurring at Naples. Differences in size class structure were significant only on a seasonal scale and within either city separately. With one exception (Fridericia bulbosa s.s.), the patterns of spatial aggregation of the common species were fairly robust and the total range of patchiness was consistent with previous studies, despite the different sampling methodologies.

The use of organic amendments is one method that may reduce the need for nematicides, but there is limited knowledge of the influence of organic amendments on endo-migratory nematodes, such as R. similis. Nine different amendments, namely, mill mud, mill ash, biosolids, municipal waste compost, banana residue, grass hay, legume hay, molasses and calcium silicate were applied to the three major soil types of the wet tropics region used for banana production. The nutrient content of the amendments was also determined. Banana plants were inoculated with R. similis and grown in the soil-amendment mix for 12-weeks in a glasshouse experiment. Assessments of plant growth, plant-parasitic nematodes and soil nematode community characteristics were made at the termination of the experiment. Significant suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes occurred in soils amended with legume hay, grass hay, banana residue and mill mud relative to untreated soil. These amendments were found to have the highest N and C content. The application of banana residue and mill mud significantly increased shoot dry weight at the termination of the experiment relative to untreated soil. Furthermore, the applications of banana residue, grass hay, mill mud and municipal waste compost increased the potential for suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes through antagonistic activity. The application of amendments that are high in C and N appeared to be able to induce suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes in bananas, by developing a more favourable environment for antagonistic organisms."

Previous studies have concentrated on the spatial distribution of heavy metals and their effects on forest ecology and indigenous mammals and birds. Soil is perceived as the major repository for the metal pollutants but there is a need to link the soil concentration of pollutants on the Kola Peninsula with biological parameters. Many standard methods currently used in soil ecotoxicology are developed and refined with artificial amendments and rarely modified for use in historically contaminated environments. In this study, forest soils were sampled along a 34 kin transect from the smelter and analysed both chemically and with a range of ecologically relevant biological tests. Soil respiration, total nematode count, microbial heterotrophic numbers and minimal inhibitory concentrations to copper and nickel were carried out on bulk soil. The soil pore water was tested with bacterial and fungal bioluminescence-based biosensors. The heterotrophic numbers and their inhibitory concentration showed strong correlation with heavy metal concentrations while decreasing biosensor luminescence was related to increasing copper concentrations present in the pore waters. Overall, there were considerable impacts on some microbial parameters but other measures including respiration and nematode populations were insensitive to pollutant levels. While chemical analysis of heavy metals proved essential in defining the extent of contamination, environmentally relevant ecotoxicological tests complemented these data by demonstrating pollutant impact. Ecotoxicological approaches that study both the bulk soil and pore water may represent the key to understanding the fate of heavy metal in soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Our analysis of this problem has been highly conditioned by the constant re-use of many of the USW landfills, since they have never been the target of any specific restoration plan. Our periodical analysis of cover soils and soils from discharge areas of the landfills indicates soil pollution has worsened over the years. Here, we examined heavy metal, salts, and organic compounds in soil and surface water samples taken from 15 landfills in the Madrid region. Impacts of the landfill soil covers on nematode and plant diversity were also evaluated. These analyses continue to reveal the presence of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd) in soils, and salts (sulphates, chlorides and nitrates) in soils and surface waters. In addition, non-agricultural organic compounds, mainly aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, often appeared in very high concentrations, and high levels of insecticides such as gamma-HCH (lindane) were also detected in soils. Around 50% of the water samples collected showed chemical demand of oxygen (COO) values in excess of 150 mg/l. Traces of phenolic compounds were detected in some landfills, some of which exhibited high levels of 2-chlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. All these factors are conditioning both the revegetation of the landfill systems and the remediation of their slopes and terrestrial ecosystems arising in their discharge areas.

Forest soil was treated with either copper (0, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mug g-1), p-nitrophenol (0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mug g-1), or trinitrotoluene (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mug g-1). Nematodes were sorted into bacterivore, fungivore, herbivore, and omnivore-predator trophic groups, and a hatchling category. Microarthropods were sorted to the acarine suborders Prostigmata, Mesostigmata, and Oribatida; the insectan order Collembola; and a miscellaneous group. Omnivore-predator nematodes and meso-stigmatid and oribatid mites were the groups most sensitive to copper and were significantly reduced at levels as low as 100 mug g-1 copper. Total nematode and microarthropod numbers declined above 200 mug g-1 copper. Trophic structure analysis suggested that high sensitivity of nematode predators to intermediate levels of copper reduced predation on herbivore nematodes and resulted in greater numbers of nematodes compared to controls. p-Nitrophenol was very toxic to the nematode community, and all trophic groups were significantly reduced above 20 mug g-1. However, there was no effect of p-nitrophenol on microarthropods. Trinitrotoluene had no significant negative effect on total abundance of either group of soil fauna, but oribatids were significantly reduced at 200 mug g-1. Our results demonstrated that soil nematodes and microarthropods were sensitive indicators of environmental contaminants and that trophic-structure and community analysis has the potential to detect more subtle indirect effects of chemicals on soil food-web structure. We conclude that microcosms with field communities of soil microfauna offer high resolution of the ecotoxicological effects of chemicals in complex soil systems."

In this study, ecological indices for soil nematode community structure and microbial populations in soils contaminated with mine drainage (CS) from an abandoned mine and of a nearby non-contaminated area (NC) were examined during the seven seasons from July 2007 through December 2008 to reveal influences of mine drainage (especially heavy metals) on the soil nematode community structure. Of the soil physicochemical characteristics measured, nutritional properties such as organic matter content, nitrogen content, and soluble cations were not significantly different between CS and NC; however, significant differences were detected in pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorus (av.P(2)O(5)), and most strikingly, the concentrations of heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Zn, and Ni. Nematodes were less abundant in CS than in NC, especially for long-living persistor-type nematodes. Comparison of ecological indices between CS and NC indicates that abundance, maturity, richness, and diversity of the soil nematode community were decreased in CS soil, indicating that soil health and function were adversely affected. Of the weighted-soil food-web indices, the structural index (SI) of the soil nematode community was significantly lower in CS than in NC, while no significant difference in the enrichment index (El) was observed between CS and NC, suggesting that the heavy metal contamination may have disturbed the soil ecosystem by suppressing biological activity. Seasonal changes in the ecological indices during the study period showed that the discrepancies between CS and NC persisted throughout most of the seasons, suggesting that the effect of mine drainage (heavy metal) contamination on nematode community structure may be little influenced by seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

We selected two adjacent farmlets to study these effects. Since 1980, one farmlet (LF) had not received superphosphate fertilizer (SSP) and has a low stock density of sheep, and the other (HF) had received 37.5 g SSP m(-2) y(-1) and has a high stock density. In 2004, at both farmlets, we commenced treatments for 4 years, adding urea to raise N status, and non-residual selective herbicide to remove broadleaf species. Long-term SSP addition and increased sheep numbers, and added urea increased herbage production but reduced plant diversity. The effect of treatments on most of the soil biochemical and biological properties varied between years. This may have partly arisen from an infestation with Wiseana caterpillars in the first winter, causing resources to be low and total soil carbon (C) to be reduced by 4-8%; total C did, however, recover in later years. The urea and herbicide treatments caused greater changes above-ground than below-ground, but they did reduce soil microbial C and N and nematode diversity; urea at LF increased mineralizable N to the levels found at HF. On an area basis, HF generally had higher total C and N. earthworm and nematode numbers (including bacterial feeders, predators and omnivores), and nematode diversity, and greater values for the nematode channel ratio, than did LF. In contrast, the ratios of microbial C/total C and microbial N/total N, total mite numbers (including Oribatida, but not other mite groups), and fungal-feeding nematode numbers were higher at LF than at HF. Canonical correlation analysis suggested the plant and soil nematode communities responded in tandem and in predictable ways to the same environmental factors. Increased quantity and quality of inputs disadvantaged the fungal-based energy channel, with a measurable decline in the quantity of fungal phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). While the quantity of bacterial PLFAs appeared to be unaffected by greater plant-derived inputs, the greater numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes at the HF farmlet suggests the activity and flow of energy and nutrients through the bacterial community would be more important in the HF than the LF farmlet. Overall our results suggest the shift from fungal to bacterial pathways may lead to soil microbial/microfaunal interactions that retain less reactive N within soil biomass, with a consequent greater risk of N loss.

This study investigated two key functional groups of soil invertebrates, nematodes and earthworms, after 10 years in a field experiment investigating three types of agricultural management practices. Agricultural management treatments were tillage (moldboard plow vs. strip tillage), inputs (synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and fumigation vs. inputs approved for organic production) and crop rotation (continuous tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L) vs. diverse vegetable rotation). The experiment was established in western NC (United States) on a fine-sandy loam (FAO: Acrisol). Nematode sampling and earthworm extractions were performed in spring and fall of 2004. The rotation effect on nematode and earthworm populations was generally non-significant. Averaged over sampling dates and other treatments, total nematode counts for synthetic input treatments were 59% of organic input treatments; likewise, plow treatments were 52% of strip till treatments. The strip till organic treatment combination (strip tillage with organic inputs) resulted in over four times as many nematodes as the plow synthetic treatment combination (moldboard plow with synthetic inputs). These data demonstrate that while nematode abundance responds sensitively to tillage and input practices individually, combinations of treatments displayed consistently greater nematode abundance when organic inputs and strip tillage were applied together. Long-term strip tillage increased earthworm populations 31-fold compared to plowed treatments. Organic inputs resulted in more earthworms than synthetic inputs in spring, but not fall. Strip tillage increased earthworm populations far more effectively than organic inputs. Even so, earthworms also displayed the positive combination effect of strip tillage and organic inputs; on average, 24 earthworms m(-2) were extracted from strip till organic treatments vs. 15 from strip till synthetic and just one from plow organic treatments. We conclude that the data support our hypothesis; there is a positive combination effect resulting in greater nematode and earthworm abundance when strip tillage and organic inputs are used together in agricultural production systems. These results confirm the long-term benefits of conservation practices observed in agricultural ecosystems and we suggest that the principle of compounded benefits from combinations of conservation practices extend to all managed ecosystems. We recommend that agricultural researchers consider both tillage and agricultural inputs when interpreting or predicting soil biological responses to agricultural management decisions.

Direct and indirect (through soil property changes), separate and integrated effects of industrial pollution and livestock activity on the soil nematode community were found. The total number of nematodes was found to be negatively correlated with the amounts of chemical elements in soil and positively correlated with the calcium concentration in soil. The nematode communities, trophic diversity, and taxon composition were found to be affected by the variety and concentration of chemical elements. The widely used ecological indices applied in the present research were sensitive to environmental disturbances caused by industrial pollution as well as livestock activity. The Wasilewska index, nematode channel ratio, and maturity index were mostly affected by trace metal concentration, while the diversity indices and species richness were mostly affected by soil property changes. The nematode channel ratio indicated that the bacterial-based decomposition process was dominant in soils exposed to both strong industrial pollution and livestock activity. The diversity indices indicated the disappearance of rare species in the industrial area and an increase of the contribution of common nematodes with increasing depth and distance from the unfavorable area. The current study confirmed that the grazing in accompaniment to industrial pollution, intensify a negative effect on soil nematode communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The potential benefits from organic farming and from low-input cropping systems have not yet been precisely assessed. Earthworm, having important agro-ecological functions, may be affected by pesticide applications, especially those species living mainly in the surface soil layer. We used a five-year experimental database including conventional and organic cropping systems to establish simple relationships between the Treatment Frequency Index - a phytosanitary indicator of pesticide pressure - and the abundance of three important earthworm species. We found that insecticides have more negative influence on earthworm species than herbicides and fungicides, and that species living in the soil's surface layer were the most affected by pesticides. Density of these earthworm species could be multiplied by a factor 1.5-4 if the Treatment Frequency Index was halved, as is currently required by some European regulations. Our results thus demonstrate that a reduction in pesticide application would increase earthworm population density in agricultural fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Field-reconnaissance surveys revealed lower species' numbers and diversity of surface and subterranean flora and fauna. The presence and absence of such plant species as Elaeis guineensis, Musanga cecropiodes, and Andropogon gayanus, as well as animal species like earthworms and nematodes in sampled plots, corroborated the evidence provided by the total extractable hydrocarbon content (of (2.53 +/- 0.43) x 10(2) mg/kg and (2.00 +/- 10.76) x 10(2) mg/kg at surface and subsurface depths, resp.) on the level of degradation and/or regeneration at the polluted site. The most important evidence that oiling must have been responsible, at least in part, for the reduction in species' number and diversity was provided by the plant cover, Andropogan gayanus, which occurred at a lower density of 0.9 plants/m(2) in the oil-impacted plots and 14.00 plants/m(2) in the unimpacted reference plots of an adjacent, geographically similar area. The presence of this species on site thus presented a significant difference (P < 0.05) of over 85%, and indicated exhaustion or impoverishment of impacted soils. Elaeis guineensis, with a population density of 0.1 stands/m(2), provided evidence of past cultivation on site, while species like Musanga cecropioides, with a density of 0.5 stands/m(2), at the unimpacted site, confirmed the abandonment of the farmstead over a long period of time. For the fauna, the most sensitive indicator of hydrocarbon toxicity was provided by nematode Xiphinema sp. that were completely absent in the oil-impacted site."

Irrigation tailwater contaminated with endosulfan is released onto floodplains to avoid direct entry into river systems where endosulfan is highly toxic to fish. We examined the short-term effects of endosulfan, at levels likely to be present in tailwaters, on soil arthropods on such a floodplain near Moree, NSW. The study consisted of four treatments: a dry control (replicates untreated), wet control (replicates flooded with water only), 1 mug/l endosulfan and 10 mug/l endosulfan. Treatments were applied in the middle of summer and soil invertebrate samples were taken 1 week. 1 month and 2 months following treatment. Invertebrates were sorted to order level and oribatid mites to species. Endosulfan sulphate was detected in all treatments, including the two controls, most likely the result of spray drift. The focus of the experiment was therefore to explore the short-term impacts of endosulfan contaminated tailwater on communities that had been previously exposed to endosulfan. More than 7700 arthropods were collected from a total sample area of 0.336 m(2). The dominant groups were the prostigmatid and oribatid mites (35 species), collembolans and hemipterans. Our analyses did not detect any short-term effect of the endosulfan treatments on the number of individuals, spatial aggregations or community structure of the soil fauna. There were clear responses to changes in soil moisture related to treatment applications. The study, therefore, made two important findings: (1) a diverse and abundant soil fauna persists on floodplains exposed to endosulfan contaminated tailwater, and (2) this diverse and abundant soil fauna were unaffected by the addition of endosulfan at concentrations common to tailwater run-off from cotton fields. There is clearly a need to determine whether these findings can be extended to soil arthropod biodiversity in areas previously unexposed to endosulfan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

No differences were detected regarding microorganisms in orchards subjected to different agricultural practices. Copper concentration was higher in vineyards. Total earthworm abundance and biomass were severely reduced both by copper input and soil tillage. Individual species gave different responses to agricultural practices. Aporrectodea caliginosa was negatively affected by both copper concentration and soil cultivation, while Allolobophora chlorotica was negatively affected only by copper input.

The results identify the detritivores as a group greatly affected by conventional agronomic practices; earthworms and isopods were significantly more abundant in the organic orchard and in the forest. With regard to predators, the greatest difference among the three study sites was found with carabids, which were caught in extremely low numbers in the conventional orchard.

Soil samples represented four different subsystems found in the CeBio Research Center, including natural/undisturbed (rainforest (RF) and savannah (SA)) and disturbed (Eucalyptus spp. (EU) and grassland (GR)) subsystems. Ecological descriptors S (3.5-9.5), d (1.22-4.23) and MI (1.9-3.23) significantly differentiated the subsystem GR (high impact) from the other subsystems. Additionally, poorly covered soil (i.e., subsystem GR) negatively influenced the composition of nematode assemblages, and primarily so for nematodes with high c-p values. Among soil variables, pH strongly influenced the distribution of soil nematodes, negatively affecting the abundance of all c-p groups and diversity of nematodes. On the other hand, pH also positively affected FF and PP trophic groups in the subsystem GR. The similarity of subsystem EU and natural subsystems (RF and SA) suggests that soil restoration with Eucalyptus spp. appears to be an adequate management practice to promote the recovery of areas subjected to mining practices."

We aimed to quantify the relative effects of these factors on the community structure of soil oribatid mites inhabiting holm oak woodlands in two Mediterranean cities. We partitioned the community variation into fractions uniquely attributable to gradients in soil abiotic properties, pollution, microbiological properties, and spatial and temporal variation that could not be related to measured soil factors. As we found strong spatial structure at the local scales, a neutral model was fitted to test whether beta diversity patterns of relatively isolated communities were consistent with a purely stochastic assembly process. The overall diversity of the assemblage was remarkable: a total of 124 species were identified and rarefaction curves demonstrated that urban parks are as rich in species as their counterpart woodlands in suburban areas. The fraction of variation explainable in terms of soil properties, microbiology and pollution was statistically significant but surprisingly low. At the site scale, patterns of beta diversity (i.e. spatial turnover in species composition and relative abundances) were not significantly different from those predicted by neutral models. Stochastic models can parsimoniously predict background levels of urban soil biodiversity at local scales, while disturbance and environmental variation still play some significant but not major role at broader scales.

Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm.

Such effects were investigated in two types of habitats: low diversity soils from an agricultural farm and high diversity soils from a natural vegetation area.

Our results show that nematode diversity was low in fumigated soils throughout the whole season and, although yearly recovery occurred within the treated fields, fumigated soils showed a permanent perturbed condition. The nematode community was more closely associated to nutrient cycling in non-cropped than in cropped soils, and the link between plant biomass and nematode community structure was weak. Non-treated furrows within the treated fields were a reservoir of both beneficial and plant-parasitic nematodes, but such difference between furrows and beds was not enough to maintain more suppressive soil assemblages in the furrows.

To enhance crops' uptake of heavy metals. chelates such as EDGA are being tested as soil additives. Heavy metal loaded EDGA can affect soil organisms such as bacteria and nematodes in various ways: directly via the soil solution surrounding the organisms and indirectly by changing the approachability, amount and quality of specific food items for nematodes and bacteria. In a pot experiment with various crops growing in slightly polluted acid sandy soil (pH 4.5, 2 mg Cd and 200 mg Zn kg(-1) soil), Cd and Zn loaded EDGA in the soil solution did not affect herbivorous nematodes but did strongly reduce the increase in bacterivorous nematodes. Moreover, while the crop-stimulated increase in numbers of bacterivorous nematodes dropped, the measured amounts and the growth of their food (bacteria) were not reduced. This differential effect of the EDGA addition occurred under moderate (grass) and strong (lupine and yellow mustard) stimulation of bacterivorous nematodes by the crops, and of moderate (grass, yellow mustard) and no (lupine) stimulation of herbivorous nematodes. We assume that EDGA addition did not increase the load of bacteria with adsorbed heavy metals. Probably the bacterivorous nematodes were inhibited to feed by the high concentration of heavy metal-complexed EDGA in the soil solution, also surrounding their prey (bacteria). Although EDGA addition to the soil stimulated uptake of heavy metals by the crops, it decreased heavy metal concentrations in the roots. Herbivorous nematodes were therefore not negatively affected by the EDGA addition to the soil. Fungivorous nematodes were negatively affected by EDGA addition. probably due to increased heavy metal concentrations in the fungal hyphae. Thus, EDGA can have significant side effects on the functioning of the soil organisms, and a thorough analysis of trophic relationships among soil organisms is needed to understand these effects.

Growth of metal tolerant grasses on two sandy soils contaminated with either copper (arable soil) or zinc (bare soil) resulted in a significant rehabilitation of soil chemical and biological properties. Methods. In the arable soil (Wageningen, the Netherlands), copper contamination caused a siginificant reduction of crop growth but the growth of a Cu-tolerant variety of Agrostis capillaris resulted in an increase in soil pH, DOC and dissolved Ca concentrations which caused a significant reduction of the free CU2+ activity from initially toxic (between 10(-5) to 10(-6) M) to non-toxic levels (between 10(-7) to 10(-10) M). Also, bacterial growth and numbers of bacterivorous nematodes, which had been strongly suppressed as a result of high Cu levels (170 mg(.)kg(-1)) in combination with a low soil pH (4.7), normalized as an effect of grass growth. In the extremely Zn-polluted bare sandy son of an old zinc smelter site (Maatheide, Belgium) with Zn levels up to 16.000 mg(.)kg(-1), biological and chemical parameters also recovered due to the growth of Zn-tolerant varieties of Agrostis capillaris and Festuca rubra during a rehabilitation study on 3 hectares. To reduce metal availability, the experimental field on the Maatheide site was treated with beringite (modified aluminosilicate originating from fluidized bed burning of coal refuse), and composted municipal waste. A mixture of the two grass varieties was sown which resulted in a well developing grass cover within 4 months. Results. The combination of the reduced chemical availability due to addition of beringite and the gradual development of the vegetation, greatly reduced the toxicity of metals present in the soil solution. Extractable amounts of Zn in a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution decreased from 525 mg(.)kg(-1) to 16 mg(.)kg(-1) in the treated plots which resulted in the normalization of the below-ground foodweb as expressed by the numbers and diversity of organisms and of metabolic functioning, such as bacterial growth and soil respiration. Under grass, approximately 10(9) bacteria, 6.10(4) protozoa, 5 m fungal hyphae and 27 nematodes were found per gram of dry soil, which was between 10 to 100 times higher than those obtained in the non-treated plots. Also the functional diversity of the soil bacterial populations, measured as the capacity to metabolize a number of different substrates, had almost doubled after soil treatment. Conclusions. Chemical (i.e. addition of beringite) and biological (growth of metal resistant crops) manipulation of soil resulted in a marked decrease of the toxicity of metals present in the soil and an increased availability of food for soil organisms that had been reduced to poverty for many years. Consequently, the soil food webs were restored."

We also employ network analysis techniques to analyze the structure of nematode assemblages on the basis of co-occurrence of genera in samples. Chemical disinfection had a direct lethal effect on all nematode genera reducing or even eliminating their populations, while organic amendments favored only the free living nematodes without affecting plant feeders. These differences were poorly reflected on changes of diversity and even less on those of nematode indices. Network analysis offered significant insights into the structural changes in the web of interactions among nematode genera. The network after chemical disinfection was smaller, poorly connected and almost entirely dependent on the dominant phytoparasite Paratylenchus.

In this experiment, four pH/copper combinations from this field were either planted with a pH- and copper-resistant grass cultivar or remained fallow. During a 10-week period, the dynamics of the microbial activity and of the abundances of bacteria, protozoa, and nematodes were measured, as were the dynamics of several chemical soil parameters. After 13 years of copper (750 kg copper per hectare) and/or pH stress (6.1 --> 4.7), which had resulted in severely reduced crop growth, no effects were observed on bacterial numbers, respiration, or protozoan numbers, but bacterial growth (measured as [H-3]thymidine incorporation into bacterial DNA) was strongly reduced in the low pH plots, and even more so in low pH plots enriched with copper. Of the organisms, only nematodes were negatively affected under conditions of high copper load at low pH. In these plots, numbers belonging to all feeding categories were strongly reduced. Planting of a copper-tolerant grass variety, Agrostis capillaris L. var. Parys Mountain, resulted within 10 weeks in faster bacterial growth and more protozoa and bacterivorous nematodes in comparison with fallow controls; these effects were markedly strongest in the acidic, copper-enriched soils. During incubation, fungivorous nematodes increased in all treatments, in fallow and in planted pots and in the pots with high-copper, low-pH soil. The results of this experiment suggest that introduction of plant growth is one of the major causes of increased biological activity in acidic contaminated soils (approximately 1.2 times the current EC limits). Planting such soils with metal-tolerant plant species can reestablish the necessary food base to support soil organism growth, and this can lead to numerous positive effects, reversing the loss of soil functions due to the high copper levels under acidic conditions."

The re-establishment of fauna in terrestrial systems is a subject that has been investigated for many years, although most studies have been conducted in laboratory conditions or oil selected species. Few studies analyzed the process at community-level in the field. We examined the colonization patterns of invertebrate communities after total depletion and in different degrees of soil pollution. Material and Methods: For this purpose, we established four patches with different environmental conditions: an untreated control area, and three areas where the soil fauna was at first completely depleted by steam sterilization and then three different concentrations of soil pollution were simulated through the addition of pesticides. On five dates (ili On five occasions) we examined the abundance and taxa richness of edaphic microarthropods and ground invertebrates. Results and Conclusion: Our data show that the abundance and richness of terrestrial invertebrates are strongly related to the presence of a pollution gradient: a high contamination level inhibits the re-establishment of faunal communities, and a low contamination level reduces the entire reinvasion process.

The percentage of eudominant, recendent, and subrecendent species increased at the expense of dominants and subdominants, all together with decreasing diversity and equitability of the community. We identified species Chamobates borealis, Carabodes rugosior, Metabelba propexa, and Pergalumna nervosa with negative respond under the heavy metal stress. Species Adoristes ovatus was indifferent and Dissorhina sp., Hafenrefferia gilvipes, and Oppiella nova prospered under the loaded conditions. Forty years after experimental afforestation, we expect specific community of actively surviving microorganisms and Oribatida species detected in the DAM are usual in the greatly degraded habitats or on sites in the early succession."

The aim of this study was to assess the microbial characteristics, composition of oribatid mite species, and level of genotoxic impact on plants in the area of inactive tailings pond (Horna Ves, Kremnica region). Sampling of the tailings, soils and selected plant species was carried out in spring of 2012. Trace element analysis (inductively coupled plasma emission and mass spectrometry) showed that concentration of Pb, Zn, and Cu in the tailings is approximately in thousands of ppm (mg kg(-1)). Amount of lead exceeded 16,000 mg kg(-1), which is perceived as the biggest threat with respect to possible toxicity. The risk is accentuated by extremely acidic pH of the tailings material which approached 2. In such conditions great mobility of (divalent) heavy metal cations is expected. The total cyanide concentration in the tailings was 472 mg kg(-1). Results of performed tests and measurements suggest that microbial activity at the tailings site (and its close environment) is hampered markedly. In the sludge material we detected low abundance of soil bacteria (2.08 x 10(4) CFU) and predominance of slowly growing K-strategists. On the other hand, the content of microbial C in the sludge sample was not too low, considering its extreme acidity and high amount of risk elements. In the same sample, just one mite species, Oppiella (O.) uliginosa (Willmann 1919), was identified. Also in case of the dam site the abundance of mites was considerably lower in comparison to reference sample. Values of Oribatida abundance were in positive correlation with values of microbial biomass carbon. Results of the pollen grain abortivity test, applied in situ on chosen plant species, indicated substantial presence of genotoxicity in the environment. Total induction index of tailings pond reached 3.59(+/- 2.4) which expresses also total load of locality, comparing to natural biotope. In case of the technogenic sediment, the value was more than three times higher."

Earthworm biomass and density fluctuated in time and increased with increasing metal contamination, indicating the presence of compensating factors. Multivariate analysis suggested organic matter and moisture content to be the main factors explaining earthworm biomass. Metal concentrations in the earthworms increased with increasing total or 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable soil concentrations, but no time-related trends were seen.

After 2 yr, comparisons of the pH 3.6 plots with the controls indicated significant decreases in the number, length and biomass of lateral roots, and the percent and number of ectomycorrhizae. Decreases in these root characteristics for plots subjected to applications of throughfall acidified to near-ambient pH 4.3 were also significant or bordered on significance. Numbers of herbivorous mites increased significantly with decreasing pH, but the predaceous mites appeared insensitive.

As an effective adsorbent for heavy metals, nanoscale carbon black (CB) can be used to immobilize metals in contaminated soil, but no information is available regarding its effect on soil nematodes. In the present study, laboratory bioassays were performed to investigate the impact of three rates (1%, 3%, and 5% mass ratios) of HNO3 or H2SO4 modified nanoscale carbon black (NCB or SCB) on the abundance and composition of nematode communities during 120 d of turfgrass growth. The results showed that 5% NCB and SCB treatments significantly increased plant shoot biomass of two crops. The total number of nematode genera in the control was greater than in nano-CB treatments. Plant parasites dominated across all treatments, with dominant genus Helicotylenchus. The abundance of total nematodes and each of the four trophic groups responded negatively to nano-CB addition. Three percent and 5% NCB addition significantly decreased the abundance of total nematodes, plant parasitic and bacterivorous nematodes, compared to the control. The species diversity, richness, community evenness and maturity index of soil nematodes were significantly decreased by 3% and 5% nano-CB compared to the control. This study revealed that modified nano-CB, as an amendment with a rate of 3% or higher, could cause significant disturbance to the soil food web and thus affect soil nematodes in the short-term.

Insecticides were applied separately and in combination to the soil surface (chlorpyrifos) and vegetation (dimethoate). The treatments were established to investigate effects of above- and below-ground insects on plant succession. Starting in 1997, the insecticides were applied from April to November at 2-week (dimethoate) or monthly intervals (chlorpyrifos). Samples were taken in 2000 prior to and after insecticide application in March and June, respectively. Both insecticides are lethal to Collembola and insecticide applications resulted in a strong decline in the density of total Collembola. Application of chlorpyrifos reduced collembolan density to a greater extent than dimethoate; the effect of the combined application on total collembolan numbers was similar to that of chlorpyrifos only. Collembolan numbers recovered after the insecticide applications in 1999, but in the treated plots populations were still reduced in March 2000 before the re-application of insecticide treatments in that year. The insecticide applications changed the dominance structure of the collembolan community, but had no effects on species composition.

These included plate counts of culturable bacteria, community level physiological profiling (CLPP) by analysis of the utilization of multiple carbon sources in BIOLOG plates, community fatty acid methyl ester (C-FAME) profiling and dehydrogenase enzyme activity measurements. These approaches were complemented with microscopic assessments of the diversity of the nematode community. Samples from two sites with different histories of heavy-metal input were assessed. Major differences in microbial and meiofaunal parameters were observed both between and within the sites. There was a large degree of congruence between each of the microbiological approaches. In particular, one sample appeared to be distinguished by a reduction in culturable bacteria (especially pseudomonads), limited response to carbon sources in CLPP, and major differences in extracted fatty acid profiles, The use of multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between microbial and physicochemical measurements revealed that CLPP and plate counts were useful for determining the gross effect of metals on soil microbial communities, whereas proportions of metal-resistant bacteria and dehydrogenase activity differentiated between the two sites. Copper and zinc concentrations and pH ah showed significant correlation with the microbial parameters. Nematode community structure was affected to a greater extent by soil pH than by metal content, but the within-site rankings were the same as those achieved for microbiological analyses.

Thirty soil cores were taken from an industrial site formerly used for the burning of waste from an explosives factory. The predominant contaminants in the soil were a range of heavy metals, including lead, copper and zinc. The numbers of culturable bacteria (especially those grown on Pseudomonas selective media) and the microbial community response to a suite of 95 carbon sources were suppressed in samples with high heavy-metal contamination. This corresponded to a reduction in the density and evenness of the nematode communities in the samples with high metal concentrations. Conversely the bacterial counts and responses to the 95 carbon sources were greater at sites with higher and more diverse populations of nematodes. However, epifluorescence counts of bacteria and the profiles of extracted fatty acids were not consistently altered by the heavy-metal contamination. These results suggest that culturable bacteria are effective indicators of pollution in soil, and reflect the perturbations seen in other components of the soil biota.

Integrated management combining the use of nematophagous fungi and crop rotation was the most effective strategy for decreasing the abundance of G. rostochiensis (up to 13%). Additionally, high diversity, low disturbance, and a slightly higher structure were observed in the nematode community in the integrated management treatment. Although nematophagous fungi and crop rotation separately were less effective in reducing G. rostochiensis abundance (41% and 23%, respectively), the free-living nematode community was not drastically affected.

Root biomass, root appearance, root disappearance and root density were all reduced by insecticide. This reduced rooting could reflect reduced root replacement, due to the reduction in root herbivory in insecticide- treated plots or could be a direct affect of insecticide application on the roots.

Soil from five selected glassworks sites as well as from nearby reference areas were analysed for total and water-soluble metal concentrations and general geochemical parameters. A battery of biotests was then applied to assess the toxicity of the glassworks soil environments: a test of phytotoxicity with garden cress (Lepidium sativum); the BioTox(TM) test for toxicity to bacteria using Vibrio fischeri; and analyses of abundancies and biomass of nematodes and enchytraeids. The glassworks-and reference areas were comparable with respect to pH and the content of organic matter and nutrients (C, N, P), but total metal concentrations (Pb, As, Ba, Cd and Zn) were significantly higher at the former sites. Higher metal concentrations in the water-soluble fraction were also observed, even though these concentrations were low compared to the total ones. Nevertheless, toxicity of the glassworks soils was not detected by the two ex situ tests; inhibition of light emission by V. fischeri could not be seen, nor was an effect seen on the growth of L. sativum. A decrease in enchytraeid and nematode abundance and biomass was, however, observed for the landfill soils as compared to reference soils, implying in situ toxicity to soil-inhabiting organisms. The confirmation of in situ bioavailability and negative effects motivates additional studies of the risk posed to humans of the glassworks villages. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V."

We hypothesized that the soil nematode community structure would differ in three land use areas (agricultural, forest and industrial soils), be modulated by soil parameters (N, P, K, pH, SOM, CaCO3, granulometric fraction, etc.), and strongly affected by high levels of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Hg) and emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products, PPCPs). Although these pollutants did not significantly affect the total number of free-living nematodes, diversity and structure community indices vastly altered. Our data showed that whereas nematodes with r-strategy were tolerant, genera with k-strategy were negatively affected by the selected pollutants. These effects diminished in soils with high levels of heavy metals given their adaptation to the historical pollution in this area, but not to emerging pollutants like PPCPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytostabilisation and ash-aided phytostabilisation applied since 2000 to an experimental site located near a former metallurgical site (Metaleurop-Nord) was shown previously as efficacious in reducing TEs mobility in soils. The aim of the study was to check whether this ten years trial had influenced earthworm communities. This experimental site was compared to plots located in the surroundings and differing by the use of soils. Main results are that: (1) whatever the use of soils, earthworm communities are composed of few species with moderate abundance in comparison with communities found in similar habitats outside the TEs-contaminated area, (2) the highest abundance and specific richness (4-5 species) were observed in afforested plots with various tree species, (3) ash amendments in afforested plots did not increase the species richness and modified the communities favoring anecic worms but disfavoring epigeic ones. These findings raised the questions of when and how to perform the addition of ashes firstly, to avoid negative effects on soil fauna and secondly, to keep positive effects on metal immobilization.

A long-term research site in Waseca, Minnesota was established in 1982 to study corn-soybean rotation. At the site, various corn-soybean crop sequences can be compared each year including corn and soybean in 1 to 5 years of monoculture and continuous monoculture of each crop. Additionally, granular nematicides (terbufos or aldicarb) have been applied to half of each plot since 2010 to minimize nematode populations, particularly plant-parasitic nematodes, across crop sequences. The nematode community, a sensitive indicator of changes in soil ecology, was assessed at this site to determine the impact of corn-soybean crop sequences and nematicide application on the soil ecosystem. Nematicide application was effective against target nematodes, herbivores, but also impacted non-target nematodes and thus soil ecology. Nematicide application decreased fungivore and bacterivore populations, diversity, and maturity; but significantly increased enrichment compared to no nematicide application. The nematode community and thus soil ecology was significantly different in corn compared to soybean cropping systems and changed most during initial years after switching crops. Cropping systems in corn supported significantly greater fungivore populations, fungal decomposition pathways, more diversity, and a more mature ecosystem compared to soybean systems. Soybean systems supported significantly greater bacterivore populations and a more disturbed, enriched ecosystem. These differences between corn and soybean systems demonstrate that each crop has a distinct impact on the soil ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The present study was undertaken in order to discern main coenological trends along a gradient of metal pollution, downwind of a zinc smelter located in the north of France. Three sites were compared within an abandoned field planted with poplar 20 years ago. The total zinc content of the topsoil varied from 4000 to 35 000 mg/kg according to distance to the smelter outlet. Changes in humus forms (shift from mull to mor) and in the degree of opening of the poplar stand (mainly caused by death or stunting of planted trees in the vicinity of the smelter) explained most of the observed variation in abundance and species composition. Sun species living at the ground surface appeared at the most polluted sites where poplar declined and was replaced by a sward of metal-tolerant herb species. The increase in abundance of the whole collembolan community was mainly due to Mesaphorura macrochaeta, the gut contents of which indicated that this species avoided the root mat and fed mainly in the mineral soil underneath. Shifts in food habits and/or in habitat were observed in several other common species, pointing to the importance of avoidance behaviour as a mechanism by which collembolan species may endure heavy metal pollution.

Soil for the experiment was taken from field sites where the same maize cultivars were grown to allow comparison between results under glasshouse conditions with those from field trials. Plants were grown in contrasting sandy loam and clay loam soils, half were sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide (deltamethrin) and soil samples taken at the five-leaf stage, flowering, and maturity. The main effect on all measured parameters was that of soil type and there were no effects of Bt trait or insecticide on plant growth. The Bt trait resulted in more soil nematodes and protozoa (amoebae), whereas insecticide application increased plant Bt concentration and altered nematode community structure. The only significant effects on soil microbial community structure, microarthropods, and larvae of a nontarget root-feeding Dipteran, were due to soil type and plant growth stage. The results indicate that, although there were statistically significant effects of the Bt trait on soil populations, they were small. The relative magnitude of the effect could best be judged by comparison with the insecticide treatment, which was representative of current best practice. The Bt trait had no greater effect than the insecticide treatment. Results from this glasshouse experiment were in broad agreement with conclusions from field experiments using the same plant material grown in the same soils."

Sewage sludge, artificially enriched with four concentrations of each heavy metal or combinations was applied in 1982 and again in 1986 to some of the plots. Ni and Zn + Ni treatments did not have significant effects on the soil nematode assemblages. Some of the Cu, Zn + Cu and Zn treatments had adverse effects, which correlated with the following changes in their structure, decrease in genus/family richness, decrease in maturity indices (MI and MI(2-5)) of the free-living nematode assemblages, reduction or elimination of the persisters (K-strategists) in favor of colonizers (r-strategists), decrease or elimination of omnivorous nematodes (Order Dorylaimida, Suborder Dorylaimma) and predatory nematodes (Order Dorylaimida, Suborder Mononchina). The increase in plant-feeding nematodes in the Zn treated plots may be due to the negative effects of the heavy metals on some of their antagonists (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi, root-nodule bacteria from Rhizobium spp.) and the elimination of predacious nematodes in these treatments. Some bacterial-feeding nematodes were found to increase, which was related to the indirect long-term effects of the heavy metals (e.g., lower competition and reduced predation pressure). The most common responses of the nematode communities to soil heavy metal pollution were found to be in agreement with the trends expected in stressed ecosystems and communities, predicted by the hypothesis that stress forces ecosystems into an early stage of development.

The aim of our study was to determine the impact of this contamination on the soil fauna; thus we compared the macro and mesofauna from a non contaminated soil to a moderately and highly polluted soil caused by oil extraction. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and soil physicochemical characterization was determined. TPH results showed two areas: highly contaminated (8150 mg TPH/kg) and moderately contaminated (1800 mg TPH/kg). The macrofauna abundance was not significantly different between the sites. The Hymenoptera, Gastropoda, Isoptera and the earthworms were the most abundant groups. The Gastropoda population decreased with the increase of TPH concentration while other groups of macrofauna increased their density (ants, isopteran and earthworms). The mesofauna was significantly more abundant in the moderately contaminated area (50,500 Ind./m(2)). The main groups present were the Acari, Collembola and ants. The Acari orders were present in similar proportions both in the control soil and in the medium and highly contaminated area, while the Collembola families varied in their proportion in the three areas. The diversity index showed that the moderately contaminated site was the more diverse both in macro and mesofauna. Many groups of fauna (earthworms, ants and Isoptera) were positively correlated to some petroleum hydrocarbons (PH), such as naphthalene. The Gastropoda and Acari were the groups that were most negatively correlated to the different hydrocarbons. The PCA differentiated significantly three groups, both in the case of macrofauna as well as for mesofauna. Earthworms were clearly associated with TPH specially the native species Protozapotecia australis.

To date, however, no studies in this region have characterized the soil biological and physicochemical properties in coffee plantations under such glyphosate application. In this study, earthworms were used as bioindicator organisms by measuring differences in the earthworm community in plots within shaded coffee plantations, with and without repeated applications of glyphosate. Differences in earthworm-induced soil processes, such as water infiltration rates, potential net carbon mineralization rates and soil physicochemical properties were also evaluated. Eight plots were selected in shaded coffee plantations; four had received regular applications of GBH over the preceding 22 years, while the other four had received no herbicides over the preceding 7 years. The earthworm species found in plots with no GBH treatment were Pontoscolex corethrurus (99%) and Amynthas corticis (1%), while A. corticis was absent in plots that had been treated with GBH. Significant differences (P < 0.01) in earthworm density (168 +/- 16 and 353 +/- 37 ind m(-2)) and biomass (22.7 +/- 1.1 and 45.4 +/- 6.9 gm(-2)) were observed in soils with and without GBH, respectively. No significant difference (P=0.08) was observed in the water infiltration rate (2 x 10(-4) +/- 4 x 10(-5) and 4 x 10(-4) +/- 1 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) with and without GBH, respectively). Soil carbon flow was greater in plots with GBH (76 +/- 7 mu g dry soil(-1) d(-1)) than in those without GBH (62 +/- 1 mu g dry soil(-1) d(-1), P < 0.005). Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in pH and in the clay, silt and Ca content of the soil. Our findings indicated reduced species number, density and biomass of earthworms, and increased net carbon mineralization rate in plots with GBH. The plots managed with glyphosate presented a negative effect on the earthworm parameters measured, and we conclude that the earthworms therefore acted as indicators of perturbation. It is also possible that this effect could be due to factors unrelated to the glyphosate that were not considered in this study, such as chemical fertilization or legume litter spatial variability, among others.

In this study, we investigated the responses of major soil biological traits to both the short- and long-term effects of pesticide inputs in golf turfgrass. Overall, golf course fairways receiving regular, high-rate pesticide inputs exhibited suppression in soil biological traits involved in litter decomposition/nutrient mineralization (decomposer arthropod abundance and acid phosphatase activity), and plant nutrient uptake/plant protection (mycorrhizal fungi). In contrast, most beneficial soil biota appeared to tolerate a low level of pesticide input. In a short-term manipulative experiment we observed that monthly applications of chlorothalonil and a single application of imidacloprid, both at a medium label rate, consistently suppressed decomposer microarthropods over a 4-month period. The imidacloprid application also reduced the total infection of mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes in roots. These results suggest that the use of pesticides as a whole does not always result in negative impacts on soil biota, but rather that the pesticide effects vary among functional groups of soil biota and are contingent upon long-term patterns of pesticide input intensity, and short-term differences in active ingredient and application program (application rate and frequency). These findings highlight opportunities for optimizing management practices to achieve pest management goals without compromising soil ecosystem services."

Herbicide concentrations were applied to the demarcated field on three consecutive occasions in splits. Macrobes extraction from soil was done under a stereo microscope at 20 x magnification. The Simpson's diversity index was used to calculate the soil macrobes diversity. Soil water content, bulk density and total porosity of sampled soils were determined. The study revealed that both herbicides and non-herbicides treatment had no statistical significance (p > 0.05) on the soil dwelling mac robes. Also, a Simpson's index of diversity, estimated as 53.46%, showed how the experimental area is lowly diverse in the specific soil dwelling macrobes identified. Significant correlations existed between the soil water content, bulk density, total porosity and number of soil macrobes at p < 0.05. This level of significance showed in most instances for Frankoquat herbicide concentration treatments as well as Roundup. For Agriherb and control treatments the correlations were present but majority was not significant. In most situations, the soil dwelling macrobes decreased with increasing soil physical conditions. Thus, the dynamics in soil physical properties affected macrobes abundance in soil, with the slightest influence coining from the herbicides concentrations used in the experiment. The study recommended that Frankoquat and Roundup herbicides could be used to control weeds on farmer's field because, their influence were slightly felt on the soil macrobes and also, quite a number soil dwelling macrobes recovered after application."

Biodiversity indices ( Shannon - Weiner, Simpson index, Margalef index, alpha index, species richness, Shaneven ( evenness) and Berger - Parker dominance) were calculated. Of these indices, estimates of species richness and evenness were most effective at highlighting the differences between the Collembola communities. Indeed, the highest number of species were found at the most contaminated site, although the Collembola population also had a comparatively low evenness value, with just two species dominating. The number of individuals per species were allocated into geometric classes and plotted against the cumulative number of species as a percentage. At Ladymoor, there were more geometric classes, and the slope of the line was shallower than at the other four sites. This characteristic is a feature of polluted sites, where a few species are dominant and most species are rare. The Ladymoor soil also had a dominance of Isotomurus palustris, and was the only site in which Ceratophysella denticulata was found. Previous studies have shown that these two species are often found in sites subject to high metal contamination. Survival and reproduction of the ""standard'' test springtail, Folsomia candida (Willem), were determined in a 4 week exposure test to soils from all five sites. Mortality was significantly increased in adults and reproduction significantly lower in the Ladymoor soil in comparison to the other four sites.

After 7, 28 and 96 days following the application soil cores were destructively sampled to determine ivermectin residues in soil and to assess possible effects on microbial biomass, nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms, micro-arthropods, and bait-lamina feeding activity. No significant effect of ivermectin was found for microbial respiration and numbers of nematodes and mites. Due to a lack of dose-response patterns no effect concentrations could be determined for the endpoints enchytraeid and collembolan numbers as well as total earthworm biomass. In contrast, EC50 values for the endpoint feeding rate could be calculated as 0.46, 4.31 and 15.1 mg ivermectin/kg soil dry weight in three soil layers (0-1, 0-5 and 0-8 cm, respectively). The multivariate Principal Response Curve (PRC) was used to calculate the NOECcommunity, based on earthworm, enchytraeid and collembolan abundance data, as 0.33 and 0.78 mg ivermectin/kg soil dw for day 7 and day 96, respectively. The results shown here are in line with laboratory data, indicating in general low to moderate effects of ivermectin on soil organisms. As shown by the results of the bait-lamina tests, semi-field methods such as TMEs are useful extensions of the battery of potential test methods since complex and ecologically relevant endpoints can be included."

Four field trials were conducted in 2006 and 2007 to evaluate Midas (R) (iodomethane:chloropicrin 50:50) for control of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne arenaria) on Celosia argentea var. cristata in a commercial floriculture production field in southeastern Florida. Midas (224 kg/ha) was compared to methyl bromide:chloropicrin (98:2, 224 kg/ha), and an untreated control. Treatments wore evaluated for effects on Meloidogyne arenaria J2 and free-living nematodes in soil through each season, and roots at the end of each season. Plant growth and root disease were also assessed. Population levels of nematodes isolated from soil were highly variable in all trials early in the season, and generally rebounded by harvest, sometimes to higher levels in fumigant treatments than in the untreated control. Although population levels of nematodes in soil were not significantly reduced during the growing season, nematodes in roots and galling at the end of the season were consistently reduced with both methyl bromide and Midas compared to the untreated control. Symptoms of phytotoxicity were observed in Midas treatments during the first year and were attributed to Fe toxicity. Fertilization was adjusted during the second year to investigate potential fumigant/fertilizer interactions. Interactions occurred at the end of the fourth trial between methyl bromide and fertilizers with respect to root-knot nematode J2 isolated from roots and galling. Fewer J2 were isolated from roots treated with a higher level of Fe (3.05%) in the form of Fe sucrate, and galling was reduced in methyl bromide treated plots treated with this fertilizer compared to Fe EDTA. Reduced galling was also seen with Midas in Fe sucrate fertilized plots compared to Fe EDTA. This research demonstrates the difficulty of reducing high root-knot nematode population levels in soil in subtropical conditions in production fields that have been repeatedly fumigated. Although soil population density may remain stable, root population density and disease can be reduced."

The range of reactions is documented, according to organisms concerned, preferred habitat (stratum), type of vegetation, successional status and importance value used. The Gamasina taxocenosis is analyzed on species level. The results show strikingly different successional developments of the gamasine communities of contaminated and control sites. The good indicator properties of these predacious mites are confirmed. Their high sensitivity to external impact combined with their importance for ecosystem functions make soil mesofauna extremely valuable for ecotoxicology. However, theoretical considerations lead to the conclusion, that only when mesofauna investigations are placed into an ecosystem context, can a judgement on the effects of an anthropogenic impact be made. The importance of taxonomy, inter-disciplinary and long-term research is stressed."

In this paper we confront the results of laboratory tests on growth, reproduction and survival of earthworms, in a Polluted and a reference field soil with a field inventory of earthworms. The field inventory includes population density, biomass and demographic composition in life stages measured monthly over a period of one year. The field inventory showed that density and biomass was higher at the polluted field site, a result in conflict with the extrapolation of the laboratory tests that showed a decrease in Population growth rate by 23% at this site compared to the reference. The field inventory and laboratory derived results agreed in the demographic composition of the population with more individuals in the younger age class at the polluted site compared to the reference. Abiotic and biotic conditions that differ between sites and could possibly explain the lower earthworm biomass and density at the reference site are discussed. We suggest that predation by the two to five times higher densities of meadow birds in spring may have caused the lower density and biomass of earthworms at the reference site. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we aimed to identify sensitive and resistant species with a consistent relationship to soil metal, concentrations. A regional survey of nine woodlands polluted to various degrees, was conducted in The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany. Oribatids were Tullgren extracted from soil cores and identified to species level, representing altogether 75 oribatid species. No relationship could be found between metal pollution and total density of oribatids, species rank abundance slope or Bray-Curtis similarity of species composition. The Shannon diversity index was lowest in the most polluted sites, but it was not significantly correlated with metal concentrations. A principal component analysis of the log-transformed species abundance data and the concentrations of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper revealed a separation between clean sites, moderately polluted sites and highly polluted sites. A redundancy analysis revealed that only the cadmium concentration in titter had a significant effect on community structure. Abundance of Tectocepheus velatus and Metabelba sp. was positively correlated with cadmium in titter, while Platynothrus peltifer and Hypochthonius rufulus were negatively correlated. For Galumna lanceolato, Suctobelbella subtrigona and Oppiella nova abundance was not associated with metals. Our survey confirms that oribatid mite communities display a great variety of responses to heavy metals.

We sampled 41 sites that differed in the type of substratum(carbonate rock, metal-rich carbonate mining waste, siliceous sand) and land management (planting Scots pine, topsoiling, leaving to natural succession), and the distance from the smelter. Our main aims were to determine which pollution variables and natural factors most influenced enchytraeid species composition, richness and density, and examine what was the effect of planting Scots pine (reclamation) on enchytraeid communities. The soils harboured on average 1 to 5 enchytraeid species and 700 to 18,300 individuals per square metre, depending on the habitat. These figures were generally lower than those reported from unpolluted regions. Redundancy and multiple regression analyses confirmed the negative impact of heavy metal pollution on both enchytraeid community structure and abundance. Among pollution variables, the distance from the smelter best explained the variation in enchytraeid communities. The concentrations of heavy metals in the soil had less (e.g. total Pb and exchangeable Zn) or negligible (water-soluble forms) explanatory power. Natural soil properties were nearly irrelevant for enchytraeids, except for soil pH, which determined the species composition. Plant species richness was an important explanatory variable, as it positively affected most parameters of enchytraeid community. The results of two-by-two factorial comparisons (planting Scots pine vs. natural succession; carbonate mining waste vs. siliceous sand) suggest that reclamation can improve soil quality for biota, since it increased the diversity and abundance of enchytraeids; this effect was not dependent on the type of substratum. In conclusion, enchytraeids responded negatively to heavy metal pollution and their response was consistent and clear. These animals can be used as indicators of metal toxicity even in the presence of high natural variability, but it is recommended to study their species composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper was to explore whether chemical or organic disinfection constitute two different types of disturbance, regarding both their severity on individual soil components and the structural changes they induce on the network of interactions among soil biochemical variables and nematode functional guilds. Network analysis, a novel approach in the context of soil ecology, was used to explore these interactions. Different plots within a field cultivated conventionally with Phaseolus vulgaris for many years were disinfected either with metham sodium or with a mixture of plant-based alternatives (neem and essential oils). Control plots receiving no disinfectants were also included in our study. One month after the treatments were applied, we estimated microbial C and N, activities of asparaginase, glutaminase, urease and phosphatase, organic C and N, inorganic N and P as well as the functional diversity of nematodes. Chemical disinfection had a direct lethal effect on all nematodes, while the effect on the microbial community was less obvious, implying that at the time of sampling, microbial populations, especially bacterial ones had started to recover from disturbance. Urease and phosphatase activities were inhibited, which may partly be responsible for the reduced amounts of inorganic N and P. Organic disinfectants reduced microbial populations, mainly the fungal ones, but they did not inhibit enzyme activities. The availability of N and P increased and nematode abundance was not affected significantly. The results demonstrate the usefulness of network analysis in providing insight into the structure and robustness of the soil network and its response to disturbance. Despite the pronounced reduction in nematode numbers due to chemical disinfection, the importance of nematode guilds within the interaction network was amplified and a more compact network was formed. On the other hand, interactions within organic plots were found to be primarily dictated by soil biochemistry. Finally, the analysis showed that both types of disinfection increased the vulnerability of the interaction network and this was more pronounced in chemically treated plots. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The study has been conducted in a Chernozem (FAO System), in a culture of Zea map L. The collected data consisted of soil analyses and tissue analyses to establish the heavy metal uptake by earthworm species. Determination of the heavy metal contents of soil has been realized in two depth intervals: 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, through the method of flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Earthworm extraction was done using formaldehyde according to the methodology in force at six months since the residual water has been applied on soil. Both for earthworm number and earthworm weight there were significant differences (p<0.05) between the values recorded in controls and treatments. i.e. the earthworm number considerably increased in the variants fertilised with swine residual water and also the earthworm weight, which confirm the earthworm preference for the organic matter provided by the residual water. Also there were significant differences (p<0.05) between the three analyzed earthworm species regarding the accumulation process of the investigated microelements and, among them. Lumbricus rubellus showed in its tissues the lowest concentration of microelements and Allolobophora rosea the highest concentrations. There were also much lower concentrations of the studied microelements in the earthworm tissues as compared with the adjacent soil in all analyzed species, and among them there was recorded the lowest content of heavy metals in Lumbricus castaneus. This aspect and also the fact that this species has been the best represented as numeric abundance in the experimental soil confirm the good capacity of this species to tolerate the presence of the heavy metals in soil and to metabolize them with the soil ingestion within the feeding process. The results of this study support the idea claiming the earthworms bioremediator potential of the soils polluted with heavy metals, as a possibility to restore their quality by maintaining in appropriate levels the earthworm populations in the agricultural lands. These findings also come to sustain the specialization of this role on earthworm species."

However, microarthropods provide important ecosystem services, contributing in particular to soil organic matter dynamics. This study focussed on the impact of metal(loid) pollution on the structure and distribution of microarthropod communities and their potential to bioaccumulate lead (Pb). Soil samples were collected from a contaminated historical site with a strong horizontal and vertical gradient of Pb concentrations. Microarthropods were extracted using the Berlese method. The field experiments showed that microarthropods were present even in extremely polluted soils (30,000 mg Pb kg(-1)). However, while microarthropod abundance increased with increasing soil C/N content (R-2 = 0.79), richness decreased with increasing pollution. A shift in the community structure from an oribatid-to a springtail-dominated community was observed in less polluted soils (R-2 = 0.68). In addition, Pb bioamplification occurred in microarthropods, with higher Pb concentrations in predators than in detritivorous microarthropods. Finally, the importance of feeding and reproductive ecological traits as potentially relevant descriptors of springtail community structures was highlighted.

Concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn were measured in soil, pore water and 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts of the soil, in adult earthworms and plant leaves. Results show that metal pollution is not a dominating factor determining the species richness and densities of the selected detritivore groups, although the biomass of the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus was positively and significantly correlated to Zn concentrations in pore water and 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts. Litter decomposition was significantly and positively correlated to detritivore biomass and 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable Cd concentrations in soil and negatively to pH-CaCl2, although the range of pH values was very small.

The experiment was carried out with representative soils from the Guadiamar basin (SW Spain), an area where the Aznalcollar mining spill affected over 4000 ha. Results indicated that the development of rhizospheres in polluted soils (coarse-textured) increases the mobilization of trace elements. In general the presence of roots has stimulatory effects on soil quality indicators such as hydrolase activities and both bacterial and nematode communities. However, the presence of high amount of metals interferes with these beneficial effects. This study provided evidence about the complexity of the impact of growing plants on trace element polluted soils. Trace element mobilization, hydrolase activities and bacterial and nematode communities in the rhizosphere are dependent on plant species, soil type, and pollution dose. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In a 3-year study, we tested that hypothesis by comparing the nematode abundance, genera composition and community structure in the soil of winter wheat crop under organic and conventional management. We found the soil type to be a stronger predictor for the total nematodes abundance than the farming system itself. In both systems nematode densities were higher in the sandy than in the clayey soil. Total abundance of nematodes was significantly higher in the organic than conventional farm only in sandy soil and only in the autumn. Significantly more plant feeders was observed in organic than in the conventional crops regardless the soil type. In the clayey soil more bacterial feeders were found in the conventional farm, while in the sandy soil in the organic one. Nematode generic richness was higher in the organic (a range of 15-35 genera) than in the conventional crops (a range of 15-29) on most sampling dates. Higher generic diversity (H') in the organic crop than in conventional was found for total nematodes in the clayey soil, and for hyphal feeders in sandy soil. H' for plant feeders were higher under organic than conventional system in both types of soil. In both farming systems bacterial feeding genera (Rhabditis, Panagrolaimus, Cephalobus and Acrobeloides) dominated in the communities. Plant feeders and omnivores were found among dominant genera only in the clayey soil, first under both systems, the latter only in the organic crops. The evaluation based on the ecological indices such as Maturity Index, Plant Parasite Index, Enrichment and Structure Index, and ratios between nematode trophic groups, showed that nematode communities under both farming systems most of the time were low matured and the soil food webs strongly disturbed."

The objectives were to determine 1) the persistence of fenvalerate and permethrin in straw, 2) the effects of the pyrethroids on epigeal Arachnida and Collembola, and other soil animals and 3) the effects of the pyrethroids on the decomposition rate of straw. The residues of fenvalerate and permethrin in straw approximately 2 months after application varied between 0.1 to above 5 mg/kg straw in 1986, 1988 and 1989, but was less than 0.5 mg/kg straw at harvest in 1991. No pesticide residues were found in straw samples taken in the following summer in the 1991 experiment. The decomposition rate of straw did not differ between permethrin and fenvalerate-treated plots and control plots. The rate of decomposition was slightly higher in sandy soil than in organic soil, but the same on tilled and non-tilled plots. Fenvalerate and permethrin affected the numbers of epigeal Arachnida and Collembola in the field. Araneae were more numerous in pitfall samples taken from control plots than in insecticide-treated plots immediately after treatment. In organic soil the difference was marginally significant after harvest. The abundance of Acarina in pitfalls was significantly lower in insecticide-treated plots than in control plots. In the sandy soil experiment, less Collembola occurred in pitfalls of fenvalerate plots than in permethrin or control plots. There were no differences in any of the groups of soil animals in soil cores extracted with dry funnels between the treatments."

Recently, use of pesticide seed treatments has come under scrutiny due to concerns over non-target impacts on beneficial insects (e.g., honey bees) and the environment. Amidst these growing concerns, however, few studies have examined how pesticide seed treatments may impact soil faunal communities across multiple feeding guilds and the soil processes they regulate. We grew corn and soybean with and without pesticide seed treatment for three years and measured the response of the soil faunal detritivore, herbivore, mixed, and predator feeding guilds, nitrogen mineralization, and surface litter decomposition at three time points each year. We found the effects of seed treatment on the soil faunal community varied in direction and magnitude by year and feeding guild and were most apparent in the predator and detritivore guilds. Guild-level effects tended to be strongest soon after planting but remained apparent throughout the crop growing season, particularly in the predator and mixed feeding guilds. We found no evidence that pesticide seed treatment affected the herbivore guild the intended target of the seed treatment, or nitrogen mineralization, surface litter decomposition, or grain yields. Collectively, these data suggest that pesticide seed treatments can alter the abundance, richness, and diversity of all non-targeted soil faunal guilds. Additional research will be necessary to determine the longer term significance of pesticide seed treatment-driven changes in non-target soil faunal communities in agroecosystems."

In the present study the combined effect of drought stress and copper pollution on microarthropods was investigated in a field study. We hypothesised that microarthropods in copper polluted soil would be more susceptible to drought than animals in control soil. Surprisingly, the abundance of microarthropods in autumn was positively affected by summer drought and copper pollution did not influence the effect of drought in a negative way. The stimulation was mainly seen as an increase of Acari, but also groups of Collembola were positively affected. We suggest that the positive effect of the enforced summer drought could be due to a rapid recovery, which further is accelerated by an increase of food resources (microbes) which have not been utilized during the drought.

Such studies were conducted to increase the understanding of interactions between chemicals and natural stressors and assess the predictive value of standardized laboratory tests with enchytraeids. The combined effect of copper and summer drought on enchytraeids was investigated in an old copper-contaminated field site at Hygum, Denmark, in three areas with different copper burdens. Each area consisted of five plots, which were divided into two subplots: one control and one drought subplot in which precipitation was excluded for a 45-d period during summer. Enchytraeids were sampled in spring (before the enforced drought began) and in autumn (after recovery from drought). Clear effects of copper were evident in both the field and the laboratory experiment. The field population density and species composition was highly affected by copper at concentrations in the range 300 to 500 mg Cu/kg dry soil and higher. In particular, a greatly impoverished species diversity was found in the copper-polluted areas. The effects of copper in the field compared reasonably well with the results of the laboratory tests. Surprisingly, possible effects of summer drought in the field were not detected in the autumn sampling, perhaps because of rapid recovery of the enchytraeid populations in both unpolluted and copper-polluted areas."

Considering this, our aim was to provide quantitative information about their diversity in mountain grasslands located at various distances from a heavily polluted industrial site, and to relate data on species composition and abundance with the heavy metal pollution affecting them. We investigated six sites, with significant difference in the concentration of heavy metal pollutants (As, Cu, Pb, Zn and Mn). We found that the species diversity and the numerical density of Acari decreased significantly with the increase in concentration of the analysed pollutants. The statistical analyses revealed the existence of mite communities that are characteristic of different levels of pollution. This differential response of soil mites, especially mesostigmatids, to heavy metal pollution highlights their potential as bio-indicators of damaged grasslands."

Pitfall trapping and soil core extraction was undertaken in both pseudoreplicated plots within whole fields on cotton farms and on experimental replicate plots of Envirofeast cotton and Lucerne. The relative abundance of surface-active springtails in cotton rows and densities of soil species from the rhizosphere were calculated. Twenty-three species of Collembola were collected from 5 fields, 19 in pitfall traps, and 11 in soil cores. Five species, Setogaster sp., Proisotoma minuta, Entomobrya unostrigata, Entomobrya multifasciata grp, and Lepidobrya sp. were numerically dominant on the ground at 86-96% of individuals and Mesaphorura sp., Folsomides parvulus, and Hemisotoma thermophila grp dominant in the soil. Native grassland samples contained 15 species of which a probable 10 were native and 8 were not found in cotton. Nineteen species of the 24 species identified from cotton were predominantly fungal feeders. Highest catches of Collembola occurred after flowering and soil Collembola increased with depth and during cotton growth on unsprayed plots but decreased on sprayed plots. Surface soil moistures affected daily catch rates with decomposing residues, crop stage, predator abundance, and season as secondary factors. Insecticide (endosulfan, pyrethroid, carbamate, and organophosphate) and predator effects were either negligible or unclear depending on the factor involved. Springtails appear to be predominately food limited during times of adequate soilmoisture in cotton fields."

The recent invasion of the Northern Great Plains by the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura; Hemiptera: Aphididae) has had potentially important implications for insect communities in soybeans of this region, although recent descriptions of this regional community are scarce. We describe how three pest management systems that vary in the intensity with which they rely on herbicides and insecticides (chemically intensive, reduced chemical, and spring cover crop treatments) affect insect pest populations, arthropod predator communities, weed assemblages,, and soybean yield and profitability. Soybean aphids exceeded economic thresholds in all three years, and insecticides successfully suppressed these, outbreaks in the two chemical treatments; aphids exceeded the economic injury level in the cover crop treatment in two of three study years. Bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata Forster; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations were sub-economic in all treatments; insecticides targeting soybean aphid also reduced bean leaf beetles in the first year of study when beetle populations were at their highest. Foliar-dwelling predator populations were substantially higher in the cover crop treatment than in the chemical treatments in all years of study; population declines in the latter treatments were strongly associated with insecticide applications targeting soybean aphids. Foliar predator populations did not rebound within the growing season after insecticides were applied. Soil predator populations were largely unaffected by treatment (except in 2006, when they were more abundant in the cover crop treatment than in the chemical treatments). Weed communities varied among treatments and study years, with few consistent trends except that the chemically intensive treatment had lower weed densities than the other treatments. Although input costs of the cover crop and reduced chemical treatments were lower than the chemically intensive treatment, the chemically intensive treatment was the most profitable of the three. Nevertheless, we contend that the cover crops can be managed more efficiently in order to increase the profitability and competitiveness of this treatment while gaining the long-term benefits gleaned from conserving biodiversity in our agroecosystems.

Sampling occasions and exact treatments were as follows: (1) before chemical herbicide spray; (2) after spray but before ploughing; (3) after ploughing but before reseeding; and (4) after 1 year of recovery. Our results demonstrate that, Acari and Collembola were the two soil fauna taxa with the highest abundance and accounted for around 96% of the relative total abundance among the various managements. Herbicide application tended to increase soil invertebrate abundance. Conversely, subsequent ploughing significantly reduced soil invertebrate abundance and had an obvious negative effect on soil primary and secondary decomposers, which were mainly due to the variations of Acari (especially Oribatida) and Coleoptera group abundance. Moreover, reseeding also reduced the individual number of the groups mentioned above, and favored those predators with a larger body size and individual weight. After 1 year recovery, Collembola abundance recovered to the pre-treatment levels, while with Arthropod and Acari groups were still fluctuating."

We tested the hypotheses: restoration enhanced the measured soil parameters; stability to disturbance was higher in degraded soil due to induced tolerance; and whether changes of the nematode assemblage were related to soil function. Even after disturbance, greater nematode abundance (>150 vs >10 per 100 g soil), nematode richness (D' > 1.0 vs >0.4) and function (>1.0 vs >0.05 mg CO2 g(-1) week(-1)) were maintained in restored than in degraded soil, respectively. An increase in nematode enrichment index (from 60 to >75) following all disturbances was attributed to the relatively high abundance of tolerant fungivores. The greater stability of the nematode structure index in degraded soil following heat and drying (120% and 125% respectively of the control), than in restored soil (90% and 30% of control) was due to a higher proportion of tolerant omnivores and carnivores. Thus some higher trophic level nematodes, with high c-p values, were tolerant to disturbance. However, stability of function was greater for restored than degraded soil, with a reduction over time in the degraded soil regardless of disturbance type. The differences in the responses of nematodes and soil function to disturbance suggest that nematodes could provide complementary insights into soil stability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The results indicated that different collembolan species responded differently to the pollution in the fields and could be divided into sensitive, indifferent, and tolerant types accordingly. The abundance of sensitive species decreased as the pollution increased, but this was not the same for indifferent and tolerant species. The dominant species changed from sensitive to tolerant species as the pollution increased. The reproduction of F. candida and S. curviseta was most sensitive to the contaminated soil compared to growth and survival; the sensitivity of the two species was similar. The growth was more sensitive than the survival for F. candida but not for S. curviseta. The growth and survival of F. candida were much more sensitive than those of S. curviseta. Sensitivity of field populations of F. candida (EC10 31 [15-46]) and hemiedaphic species Folsomia quadrioculata (EC10 52 [0.7-102]) were comparable with sensitivity of the reproduction of F. candida in the single-species tests (EC10 21 [14-27]), suggesting that single-species test based on laboratory cultures and field soil could be used to link laboratory and field data and then reflect the field situation.

We found that intercropping with A. lancea and the furrow application of BOF significantly changed the community composition of soil invertebrates and increased their biodiversity, as estimated by the Shannon and Simpson indices. Intercropping with A. lancea significantly reduced the proportion of Collembola, such as Tullbergia, Onychiurus, Folsomia and Folsomina, while the furrow application of BOF significantly increased the abundance of Collembola, such as Isotomidae compared with conventional monoculture. The intercropping significantly increased the proportion of Acarina, such as Mesostigmata and Oribatida, whereas the furrow application of BOF did not increase this proportion compared to conventional monoculture. The intercropping and application of BOF significantly reduced the damping-off in seedling and root rot disease at the maturation stage and increased peanut yield. The leaf spot disease of peanut was significantly suppressed by the intercropping but not by the application of BOF.

The total concentration of REEs was analyzed and the results were compared with that of the sample from a control site. The effects of the amount of REEs in the soil on the soil macrofauna community were also analyzed. The results showed that the accumulation of REEs in soil was significant in the study area and its concentration was strongly correlated with the distance from the pollution source. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated the significant differences in soil macrofauna communities among the different sites. The ordination obtained through the redundancy analysis demonstrated that the concentration of REEs and the total nitrogen, total potassium and pH, had affected the soil macrofauna community. A small amount of REEs in the soil can promote the diversity of soil macrofauna, but a large amount of REEs can reduce its diversity. The insect groups of Carabidae and Dermaptera were comparatively sensitive to the concentration of REEs in soil, and could be used as an indicator of soil pollution of REEs.

Earthworms were absent in the highly polluted area (concentration from 30,000 to 5000 mg Pb . kg(-1) of dried soil), just near the factory (0-30 m area). A clear and almost linear relationship was observed between the proportion of juvenile versus mature earthworms and the pollution gradient, with a greater proportion of adults in the most polluted zones (only adult earthworms were observed from 30 to 50 m).Apporectodea longa was the main species present just near the smelter (80% of the earthworms were A. longa from 30 to 50 m). The earthworm density was found to increase progressively from five individuals . m(-2) at 30 m to 135 individuals. m(-2) at 140 m from the factory. On average, metal(loid) accumulation in earthworm tissues decreased linearly with distance from the factory. The concentration of exchangeable metal(loid)s in earthworm surface casts was higher than that of the overall soil. Finally, our field study clearly demonstrated that metal(loid) pollution has a direct impact on earthworm communities (abundance, diversity and proportion of juveniles) especially when Pb concentrations in soil were higher than 2050 mg. kg-1.

HMO had no significant impact but the synthetic insecticides, irrespective of spray frequency or spray volume, significantly reduced the abundance and species diversity of the arthropods including springtails and generalist predators, such as spiders, staphylinid beetles and mesostigmatid mites. In the second orchard, blocks of Washington navel and Valencia orange trees were sprayed with either HMO or methidathion; sprays were applied twice, 2 weeks apart, in late summer (February), first at a rate of 6500 L/ha and second at 5500 L/ha. Results were similar to those in the first orchard, except that the effect of methidathion on carabid beetles and ants was not significant."

A.","Comparative impact of an anthranilic diamide and other insecticidal chemistries on beneficial invertebrates and ecosystem services in turfgrass",2012,"Pest Management Science","10.1002/ps.2321","BACKGROUND: Chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide insecticide labeled for turf, combines strong selective activity against key pests with low vertebrate toxicity. The hypothesis that it is less disruptive to beneficial invertebrates and their ecosystem services than are other prevailing insecticide classes was tested. Plots in golf course settings were treated with chlorantraniliprole, or with a representative nicotinoid (clothianidin), pyethroid (bifenthrin) or a combination (clothianidinbifenthrin) formulation. Non-target effects were assessed via pitfall traps (epigeal predators), Tullgren funnel extraction (soil microarthropods), hand sorting (earthworms), counting ant mounds and earthworm casts on tees and putting greens, assessing predation on sentinel pest eggs and comparing grass clipping decomposition in treated versus untreated turf. RESULTS: Chlorantraniliprole had little or, in most cases, no impact on predatory or soil invertebrates, predation or decomposition. Each of the other insecticides temporarily reduced abundance and activity of one or more predator groups. Clothianidin and the clothianidin-bifenthrin combination retarded grass clipping decomposition, and the combination suppressed earthworms and casts more than did carbaryl, a toxic standard. CONCLUSION: Chlorantraniliprole is compatible with conservation biocontrol and a good fit for industry initiatives to use relatively less toxic pesticides. One caveat is that its use on golf courses may require targeted management of ant mounds and earthworm casts that are suppressed as a side effect by some less selective insecticides.

Two different doses of sludge (7.5 per cent and 15 per cent) were applied to fertilize soil that was used to restore a quarry after opencast mining. Mean annual arthropod density increased when sludge was applied, but the 15 per cent dose caused an impoverishment of the community structure and a decrease of the soil oribatid diversity. Julidae (Diplopoda) and large predators of the mite family Parasitidae (Mesostigmata) were the most depressed taxa, whereas some groups depending on the availability or quality of organic matter (such as the immature Coleoptera or the Uropodidae), or on water availability (such as Collembola) were stimulated. Among the oribatids, Punctoribates sp. was the most depressed, whereas the more common little Oppias were significantly favoured. The application of sludge at a dose of 15 per cent must be avoided in order to preserve the soil biodiversity. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

They show that the species and ecological structure of these communities change abruptly in the impact zone (1 km from the source of emissions), compared to the background zone (30 km from the source), which involves a decrease in the abundance and diversity of Collembola. Their total abundance and species richness in the zone of intermediate disturbance (7 and 4 km) are considerably higher than in the background zone, and the species structure of communities is characterized by superdominance. Four species groups differing in sensitivity to pollution are distinguished. Preference for zones with different pollution levels in closely related species is regarded as a case of ecological vicariation."

HD was thoroughly incorporated into Sassafras sandy loam (SSL) soil (4.9% OM) and an oak-beech forest silt Loam soil (FS, 16% OM) at nominal HD concentrations ranging from 6 to 1076 mg kg(-1). After a 7-day incubation period, microarthropods were extracted from soils using a high-gradient extractor and sorted to Acari suborders Prostigmata, Mesostigmata, and Oribatida, and the insect order Collembola. Nematodes were extracted using Baermann funnels and were sorted into bacterivore, herbivore, fungivore and omnivore/predator trophic groups. Microarthropods were more sensitive to HD in both soil types compared with nematodes. The EC50 vaLues for total numbers of microarthropods in SSL and FS were similar (65 and 71 mg kg(-1), respectively). The EC50 values for total numbers of nematodes were 130 and 235 mg kg(-1), respectivety. Toxicity of HD to nematodes was significantly greater in SSL soil compared to FS, based on 95% confidence intervals. Results show that community-level assessment of chemical toxicity in soil using a microcosm assay is sufficiently robust and can provide the means for validating the ecotoxicity data from standardized Laboratory single-species toxicity tests.

Halofenozide caused no reduction in abundance of any group of beneficial invertebrates. Scavenging on fresh-frozen A. ipsilon larvae was reduced for approximate to 1 wk after use of imidacloprid or bendiocarb, but predation rates on eggs or pupae of A. ipsilon, and on implanted P. japonica eggs. were unaffected.

The ecological effects of the sludge were compared with the ecological effects of an inorganic fertilizer, Decreases in abundance of the microarthropods ranged from 20 to 80% of the control level after 1 year. Isotoma notabilis Schaffer was the only species that exhibited stimulation at twice the control level due to the sludge. The least affected collembolan species was Lepidocyrtus cyaneus Tullberg, a member of the surface-dwelling life forms, Sensitive species were Isotoma anglicana Lubbock and Isotomiella minor Schaffer. In subhabitats with almost no application of sludge due to a heterogeneous horizontal distribution, the microarthropods were still affected to the same degree as those in the zones of maximum application. Laboratory tests with Folsomia candida Willem gave results similar to the effects on field populations concerning the sludge but revealed no adverse effects of the fertilizer, Decomposition was stimulated to the same extent in the field by the two types of fertilizer but in the laboratory the sludge caused the largest stimulation. The effects on the microarthropod fauna are suggested to be the result of a combination of direct toxicity and changes in the microbial community due to fertilizers. (C) 1997 Academic Press."

In grasslands, both structure and functioning was suspected to be affected by a mixture of copper, lead, and zinc. Therefore, the structural and functional variables were studied simultaneously using Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs). Comparing averages of low- and high-polluted soil, based on total metal concentrations, did not show differences in structural and functional variables. However, nematode community structure (Maturity index) negatively correlated with metal concentrations. Next to that, multivariate statistics showed that enchytraeid, earthworm and, to lesser extent, nematode diversity decreased with increasing metal concentrations and a lower pH in the soil. Bacterial CFU and nematode biomass were positively related with decomposer activity and nitrate concentrations. Nitrate concentrations were negatively related to ammonium concentrations. Earthworm biomass, CO(2) production and plant yield were not related to metal concentrations. The most metal-sensitive endpoint was enchytraeid biomass. In all analyses, soil pH was a significant factor, indicating direct effects on organisms, or indicating indirect effects by influencing metal availability. In general, structural diversity seemed more positively related to functional endpoints than structural biomass. TMEs proved valuable tools to assess the structure and function in metal polluted field situations. The outcome feeds modeling effort and direct future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

For this, soils were sampled from specific grasslands in the Netherlands that contain elevated heavy metal concentrations (Cu, Pb and Zn). Soils that showed the largest differences in metal concentrations were incubated in the laboratory using Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs). This approach enabled simultaneous measurement of structural (bacteria, nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms) and functional parameters (nitrogen leaching, feeding activity, CO(2) production, plant growth). The highest polluted soils showed a lower bacterial growth, and decreased enchytraeid and nematode biomass and diversity, hence a deprived community. More nitrate leached from high polluted soils, while all other functional endpoints did not differ. Additional stress application of zinc and heat was used to test the stability. Zinc treatment caused effects only in the higher polluted soils, observed at several moments in time for enchytraeids, CO(2) fluxes and plant growth. Heat stress caused a large reduction in enchytraeid and earthworm biomass. Ammonium leaching was decreased by heat treatments in the most polluted soils, while CO(2) was increased by heat in less polluted soils. Most effects were seen in the most polluted systems and it was concluded that they seem less stable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The dissolved Cu or Zn concentrations measured after equilibrating soil samples with a 0.01 M solution of CaCl2, showed that the metal concentrations found in soils with combined metal additions were not significantly different from those with single metal additions. After an exposure period of six months, many nematode community parameters and individual nematode taxa were significantly affected by increasing concentrations of Cu and Zn up to 200 mg kg(-1). Some nematode taxa, such as Thonus, Alaimus and Aporcelaimellus were very sensitive and disappeared at Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding 50 mg kg(-1). For several nematode community parameters and nematode taxa, EC50 values for single metal exposures were used to calculate TU50 values for the joint toxicity of Cu and Zn. Based on these calculations, it is concluded that the effects of a combined exposure to Cu and Zn were additive or less than additive.

Effects on the nematode community were assessed after 10 years of exposure under field conditions. Both copper and pH had major influences on nematodes. The effect of copper was generally enhanced with decreasing soil pH. The lowest copper application rate which had a significant negative effect on the total number of nematodes was 250 kg . ha(-1) at pH 4.0, which is equivalent to a copper concentration of 0.32 mg .

Combinations of high copper and low pH significantly reduced the number of bacterial-feeding nematodes, whereas the number of hyphal-feeding nematodes increased. Omnivorous and predacious nematodes showed the most sensitive response, becoming extinct when Cu-CaCl2 was 0.8 to 1.4 mg . L(-1). Plant-feeding nematodes showed the largest differences in abundance and appeared to reflect the effects of copper and pH on primary production.
